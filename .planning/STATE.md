# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-04)

**Core value:** Reliable, real-time acquisition of device data into state_man -- if the device pushes a record, the system captures it and makes it available as a DynamicValue stream.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 - msocket TCP Layer

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 10 (msocket TCP Layer)
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-03-04 -- Completed 02-01 (MSocket TCP layer)

Progress: [███████░░░] 75%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Phases 1 and 2 can be parallelized (DV extraction and msocket have no dependency)
- Roadmap: DynamicValue extraction is Phase 1 because it is a cross-repo blocker (open62541_dart)
- Roadmap: Stub server is its own phase (Phase 4) to establish TDD infrastructure before field catalog
- [Phase 01]: Used static methods on OpcUaDynamicValueSerializer (not extension methods) for explicit OPC UA dependency and future protocol extensibility
- [Phase 01]: autoDeduceType made private static on serializer (only used internally by serialize)
- [Phase 01]: common.dart uses barrel import for OpcUaDynamicValueSerializer (no separate import needed)
- [Phase 01]: Phase 1 complete -- DynamicValue is fully protocol-agnostic, make-dynamicvalue-more-generic branch ready for merge
- [Phase 02]: Used Completer instead of asFuture() for socket done tracking (asFuture leaks SocketExceptions to test zones)
- [Phase 02]: BehaviorSubject for status stream replay (consistent with tfc_dart patterns)
- [Phase 02]: Used RawSocketOption.levelSocket/levelTcp constants from dart:io (not hardcoded integers)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- ~~Phase 1: make-dynamicvalue-more-generic branch status in open62541_dart is unknown~~ RESOLVED: Branch has 4 clean commits, all tests pass
- Phase 5: Decimal handling strategy (Decimal package vs string preservation) needs decision before parser implementation
- ~~Phase 2: Platform-specific SO_KEEPALIVE constants (macOS vs Linux) need verification on deployment target~~ RESOLVED: Constants verified from macOS system headers and centroid-is/postgresql-dart reference implementation. All tests pass on macOS.
