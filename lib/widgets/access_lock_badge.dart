/// A lock glyph for the menu entry at [path], and nothing at all when that

///
/// **The `operate` short-circuit comes first, before anything is watched.**
/// Every route this build does not raise answers [AccessGroup.operate], which
/// is what an anonymous session already holds, so the answer is known from the
/// path alone. That is what makes the badge free for the hundreds of ordinary
/// page entries: they neither subscribe to the session nor cause
/// `accessRepositoryProvider` to be built, and a station that raises no routes
/// renders its whole menu without ever reading the database or the station
/// keychain. It is also why adding this widget to a menu row cannot change how
/// that row lays out — with nothing to show it is a `SizedBox.shrink()`,
/// measured at `Size.zero` by `test/widgets/access_lock_badge_test.dart`.
///
/// **It calls [resolveAccessGate] rather than deciding for itself.** A badge
/// with its own copy of "locked when…" is how a lock ends up on a page that
/// opens, or an open page ends up wearing a lock — the first time one of the
/// two copies is edited. The only things it decides are the path lookups, and
/// both of those come from `lib/access_routes.dart`, which is where the route
/// table gets them too. In particular the database-outage exemption is
/// [routeAllowedWhenRepositoryUnavailable] and never a boolean literal, so
/// Server Config's badge and Server Config's gate agree in every repository
/// state, including both causes of an unavailable one.
///
/// **Waiting renders nothing, like a lock.** A menu popup is built in one
/// frame and read immediately; a lock that appears a frame late is better than
/// one that flashes on every menu open. Same ruling as `AccessStatusAction`,
/// which renders nothing rather than a placeholder while the session resolves.
///
/// **No tooltip.** This lives inside a popup route, and a tooltip overlay above
/// a popup overlay is a bug waiting to happen. The explanation belongs on the
/// locked page, which is one tap away.
/// True when [path] names a route this session cannot open.
///
/// **One copy of the question, deliberately.** [AccessLockBadge] draws a lock
/// from this and the navigation menu hides an entry from it. Two copies of
/// "locked when..." is exactly how a lock ends up on a page that opens, or a
/// page vanishes that would have opened — the first time one of them is edited.
/// It calls [resolveAccessGate] for the same reason the badge did: the route
/// gate and the menu must agree in every repository state, including both
/// causes of an unavailable one.
///
/// **Call it from `build`.** It `watch`es, so a menu rebuilt after somebody
/// signs in shows the entries they can now reach without being reopened.
/// Pass `watch: false` from a callback that runs OUTSIDE `build` — a
/// `PopupMenuButton.itemBuilder`, for instance, which Flutter invokes when the
/// menu opens rather than while the owning widget is building. `ref.watch` is
/// only legal during build, and calling it from such a callback does not
/// rebuild anything; it silently fails to track. A popup is built afresh every
/// time it opens, so a read is the right answer there anyway.
