/// Tap-time elevation: decide when the control is **pressed**, and never issue
/// a write that will be refused.
///
/// ## What this changes
///
/// Before this file, an operator met a lock by pressing a button, watching an
/// `AccessDenied` be thrown deep inside `GuardedStateMan`, and seeing a prompt
/// only because the guard publishes to `accessDenialsProvider` *before* it
/// throws (`access_denied_prompt.dart`). Thirty-one call sites let that
/// exception past them. This file moves the decision to the tap: the group is
/// resolved synchronously from the snapshot 04-05 loads, and a refused control
/// never composes a value, never calls `StateMan.write`, and never raises an
/// exception on the operator's path.
///
/// `GuardedStateMan` is unchanged and still enforces underneath. This is a
/// **second** gate, not a replacement — the UI check is advisory and the guard
/// is the enforcement point, which is why `tag_access_guard_test.dart` asserts
/// that a write skipping this helper is still refused (T-04-32).
///
/// ## It reuses the denial path rather than building a second one
///
/// [guardTagWrite] publishes the same [AccessDenied] the guard publishes, onto
/// the same stream, so `AccessDeniedPrompt` shows the same prompt with the
/// same copy and the same de-duplication. There is no prompt in this file and
/// no copy string of its own; if a tap-time refusal ever needs different
/// words, that is an edit to `access_denied_prompt.dart`'s constants.
///
/// The alternative was a second prompt widget with a second copy of "this did
/// not happen" — and then two things to keep in step every time the wording
/// changes, in a phase whose whole point is that the operator is told what
/// permission is missing. One publisher and one listener is also what keeps
/// T-04-35 true: one refusal, one prompt.
///
/// ## And it records the refusal itself — this is the half somebody will want
/// to delete
///
/// Before this file, an operator jabbing a locked Start produced a denial row
/// from the guard on every press. After it, **the guard never sees the
/// press.** If this function did not record, the trail would go quiet in
/// exactly the case plan 03-04 called "a signal, not noise", and a missing
/// audit row is the one defect nobody notices: it looks identical to an action
/// that never happened.
///
/// So the refusal is recorded here, with `allowed: false`, the member, and a
/// **null `newValue`** — no value was ever composed, because the control
/// refused before the caller built one. That null is meaningful rather than
/// missing, and it is what tells a tap-time refusal apart from a guard refusal
/// in the trail. Phase 5's audit page will want that difference.
///
/// ## Nothing is greyed
///
/// A locked control renders its value, takes the tap, and explains itself.
/// [TagLockBadge] annotates a control; it never disables one and never takes a
/// tap of its own. Nothing here returns a disabled widget, and
/// `tag_access_guard_test.dart` greps this file to keep it that way (T-04-33).
///
/// ## Nothing is replayed
///
/// The refused action is not held anywhere. Signing in re-opens the
/// affordance; making the change again is the operator's to do, and
/// `kAccessDeniedNoReplayNote` is what tells them so (T-04-34).
