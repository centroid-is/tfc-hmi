/// emits a whole new value through one `ValueChanged<AuditTrailFilters>` and
/// nothing else. That is `AlarmLevelFilterChips`' shape
/// (`lib/widgets/alarm.dart:102`), and it is what lets the bar be pumped in a
/// widget test without a database, a provider or a session.
///
/// ## The one default exclusion, and why it is on screen
///
/// The ROADMAP names exactly one default exclusion: `operate`. A jog button
/// pressed four hundred times an hour would otherwise be the whole page.
/// CONTEXT then rules that the exclusion is a **visible control** — a normal
/// group chip rendered deselected, with a one-line note — because hidden
/// behaviour reads as a bug and the row count would otherwise be inexplicable.
/// That note is [kAuditTrailOperateNote] and it renders whether or not
/// `operate` is currently selected.
///
/// Two other exclusions were offered and rejected: defaulting to denials-only,
/// and default-hiding `origin: 'system'`. The MCP reconnect noise is real, and
/// hiding it by default would make the page lie about what the station did.
/// Neither is implemented here, and neither should be added without reopening
/// that decision.
///
/// ## Nothing here queries anything
///
/// The `who` options are a parameter, the result summary is a parameter, and
/// the refresh affordance is a callback. The bar issues no statement, reads no
/// provider and starts no periodic timer. Its single timer is the keystroke
/// debounce below, which is one-shot and dies in `dispose`.

/// ## Why there are eight chips and not seven
///
/// Auth rows — `login`, `login.failed`, `logout`, `session.timeout` — carry an
/// **empty** `group_required`, because signing in is not gated on a group. A
/// bare `group_required IN (...)` would therefore drop every sign-in from the
/// page. CONTEXT rejected putting auth rows on a separate tab precisely because
/// interleaving is what preserves "who signed in right before this write", so
/// the rows have to stay in the list; the eighth chip is what makes them
/// *filterable* rather than unconditional. `AuditTrailStore.entries` ORs the
/// `surface = 'auth'` leg in for it.
///
/// ## Selection semantics: what is shared with `AlarmLevelFilterChips`
///
/// **Shared, and locked.** Nothing selected means no constraint — every group,
/// every row. CONTEXT's words: *"Filters combine: AND across dimensions, OR
/// within a multi-select dimension, empty selection = no constraint. Identical
/// to `AlarmLevelFilterChips` (`lib/widgets/alarm.dart:96-101`), so the
/// semantics are already learned."* It reads backwards on first encounter —
/// deselect everything, see everything — and the next reader's instinct will be
/// to "fix" it into "empty means nothing matches". That inversion was proposed
/// once in this phase, labelled a documented divergence, and reverted. This
/// widget therefore does not block the empty state and does not helpfully
/// re-select anything to prevent it.
///
/// **Not shared: the *initial* set.** `AlarmLevelFilterChips` starts empty;
/// this one starts with the six non-`operate` groups plus auth selected
/// ([kAuditTrailDefaultGroupNames]). That single difference — a non-empty
/// default rather than an empty one — is the entire mechanism by which
/// `operate` is excluded on open, and it is the only reason the row count
/// differs from an unfiltered table. It is also why [kAuditTrailOperateNote]
/// has to be beside these chips.
///
/// ## No counts
///
/// `AlarmLevelFilterChips` puts a count on each chip and can, because it
/// filters in memory over a list it already holds. Every filter here is pushed
/// into SQL, so a chip could not state how many rows it would add without a
/// second query per chip, and a count over the loaded window would be a number
/// that looks authoritative and is not. The result count is stated once, above
/// the list, labelled with the window it came from.

/// is right for the alarm page, whose search filters a list already in memory:
/// six keystrokes there are six cheap passes over a few hundred objects.
///
/// Here they are six **database** queries, and each one is potentially over the

/// field escapes the seven-day default: *"the search bar searches the database,
/// not the loaded page … Searching must answer 'has anyone ever written this
/// key', not 'did anyone this week'."* `AuditTrailFilters.isSearching` flips
