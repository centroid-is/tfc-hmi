/// What a refused write looks like to the person who made it.
///
/// `AccessDenied` is thrown on the write path by `GuardedStateMan` and
/// `GuardedPreferences`, at roughly thirty asset call sites, none of which
/// handles it. Without this widget the visible result of the first denial on a
/// plant is a debug-mode red screen or, in release, nothing at all — and
/// "nothing at all" is worse, because the operator presses the button again.
///
/// **This prompt does not depend on anybody catching the exception.** Both
/// guards fire `onDenied` — which `lib/providers/*.dart` routes into
/// [reportAccessDenial] — *before* they throw, so the event reaches this
/// listener whether the call site swallows the throw, logs it, or lets it
/// escape to the framework. That ordering is the whole safety net; it is
/// asserted in `guarded_state_man_test.dart` ("the rows are written before the
/// exception is raised") and end-to-end in `access_denied_prompt_test.dart`.
///
/// **This is the safety net, not the good version.** Phase 4 is where the
/// elevation prompt fires at *tap* time and the control itself renders locked,
/// so a write that would be refused is never issued. What ships here is that
/// every denial reaches the operator meanwhile.
///
/// **Since plan 04-11 the good version is in front of it on the tag path.**
/// Every `StateMan` write site in `lib/` goes through `writeTag`
/// (`tag_access_guard.dart`) and resolves before it issues — see
/// [kUncaughtAccessDeniedWriteSites], which is 0 and says what that does and
/// does not mean. This widget is unchanged and still needed: the guards still
/// throw, `GuardedPreferences` has no tap-time gate, and a future site that
/// skips `writeTag` lands here.

/// How many `StateMan` write call sites in `lib/` do **not** handle
/// `AccessDenied`.
///
/// Derived on 2026-08-30 by walking every `.dart` file under `lib/`, dropping
/// comment lines, and counting the calls whose receiver is a `StateMan`:
///
/// ```sh
/// grep -rnE '\b(client|stateMan|sm|widget\.stateMan)\.write\(' \
///   --include='*.dart' lib/ | grep -v ':[0-9]*: *//'
/// grep -rn 'AccessDenied' lib/page_creator lib/widgets lib/pages   # empty
/// ```
///
/// `access_denied_prompt_test.dart` runs the same walk in Dart and asserts the
/// number, so the count cannot quietly grow, and it also asserts the second
/// grep is empty — the claim that none of these sites *handles* the refusal is
/// checked rather than assumed.
///
/// **What this number counts, in the terms the phase agreed and no softer.**
/// A site counted here is one where `AccessDenied` is not handled — where it
/// escapes as an unhandled asynchronous error, or where a bare `catch (e)`
/// swallows it into a log line or renders its developer string into a
/// snackbar. **None of those is a handling**: not one of them tells the
/// operator what permission was missing or offers a way through, which is why
/// they were all counted.
///
/// The operator saw this prompt in every one of those cases anyway, because
/// the guard publishes to `accessDenialsProvider` before it throws. Phase 4's
/// tap-time elevation is what removed the throw from the operator's path, by
/// never issuing a write that will be refused.
///
/// **2026-08-30, plan 04-10: 31 -> 22.** Nine sites moved onto
/// `writeTag` (`tag_access_guard.dart`), which owns the `.write(` call, so
/// their files no longer appear in the walk at all:
///
/// | File | Sites | Member passed |
/// |---|---|---|
/// | `conveyor.dart` | 1 | the pane's `write(field, …)` field |
/// | `sensor.dart` | 1 | the `ST_Sensor_HMI` member being set |
/// | `schneider.dart` | 1 | the parameter the edit changed |
/// | `recipes.dart` | 2 | none — both replace a whole line or the whole array |
/// | `number.dart` | 1 | none — a scalar key |
/// | `start_stop_button.dart` | 1 | none — a command BOOL |
/// | `analog_box.dart` | 1 | none — a scalar setpoint |
/// | `conveyor_gate.dart` | 1 | none — a force BOOL |
///
/// **2026-08-30, plan 04-11: 22 -> 0.** The last twenty-two, same move:
///
/// | File | Sites | Member passed |
/// |---|---|---|
/// | `beckhoff.dart` | 8 | none — `force`, `on_filters` and `off_filters` are arrays, so the channel is an index and not a member a template could have a rule for |
/// | `beckhoff.dart` | 1 | `p_cmd_Reset` — the EL9222 reset, a genuine struct member |
/// | `advantys_stb.dart` | 8 | none — the same three arrays |
/// | `button.dart` | 3 | none — a command BOOL |
/// | `section_button.dart` | 2 | the `p_cmd_*` bit being set on `ST_Section_HMI` |
///
/// Both numbers were **re-derived by running the walk**, never by subtracting.
///
/// ## What the zero claims, and what it must not be read as claiming
///
/// Zero means: **no `StateMan.write` call site in `lib/` can present an
/// operator with an unexplained refusal.** Every one of them now goes through
/// `writeTag`, which resolves the permission at the tap, prompts, records the
/// refusal and issues nothing.
///
/// Zero does **not** mean `AccessDenied` is never thrown. `GuardedStateMan`
/// still throws it, deliberately, and it is still the enforcement point — the
/// tap-time check in front of it is advisory, and a write that skips
/// `writeTag` is refused there instead (`tag_access_guard_test.dart`, T-04-32).
/// Reading "0 uncaught sites" as "refusals no longer happen" would be exactly
/// the wrong conclusion about the layer underneath.
///
/// It is not deleted now that it is zero. A constant at zero with a live
/// derivation is a regression test: a future asset that writes without
/// `writeTag` reopens the gap, and `access_denied_prompt_test.dart` is what
/// says so on the next run. That is also why the walk itself is guarded —
/// the scan still finds `tag_access_guard.dart`'s own `sm.write`, so a walk
/// that had quietly stopped finding anything could not pass as a zero.
