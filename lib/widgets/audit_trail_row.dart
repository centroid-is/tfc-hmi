/// The audit trail list item: one row, and one human action, rendered the way
/// an engineer reads them.
///
/// Two widgets live here. [AuditEntryLine] draws one `AuditEntryData` — the
/// collapsed line, and also every child of an expanded action, so a member row
/// and a scalar row cannot drift apart. `AuditActionTile` (plan 05-04 task 3)
/// draws one `AuditAction` on top of it.
///
/// ## Why red is almost never on this page
///
/// Spec §2 says a denied write is the more interesting audit line, and that it
/// is how a role configured too tightly gets found. Finding the refusals has to
/// be fast, which means the other rows must be quiet: a denial carries a
/// leading bar in `HmiStateColors.red` and an allowed row carries **no** colour
/// at all. A page of allowed writes therefore holds exactly as much red as it
/// holds denials.
///
/// `lib/pages/key_repository.dart` reaches into Material's raw colour palette
/// directly for its red. That is a known violation of the colour convention
/// that predates it — every colour in this file comes from
/// `HmiStateColors.of(context)`, and a test in
/// `test/widgets/audit_trail_row_test.dart` reads this file's source and fails
/// if the word before `.red` is ever the palette's rather than the theme
/// extension's. The grep it runs is literal, so the offending spelling does not
/// appear anywhere in this file, comments included.
///
/// ## The open surface vocabulary
///
/// **1. `surface` has four values today and the list is open.** They are `tag`,
/// `pref`, `route` and `auth` (`kKnownAuditSurfaces` in
/// `lib/core/audit_trail_grouping.dart`, which is a change-detector and not a
/// whitelist). Phase 6 adds a fifth, `admin`, for role and user administration:
/// `itemKey`s `role.create` / `role.update` / `role.delete` / `role.rename` and
/// `user.create` / `user.delete` / `user.role` / `user.password`, all carrying
/// `groupRequired: 'users'`. That is confirmed, scheduled work, not a
/// hypothetical, and Phase 5 ships first.
///
/// **2. This widget therefore branches on `isAuthEntry` and on nothing else.**
/// There is no exhaustive switch over `surface`, no `default: throw`, no
/// `assert(false)`. An unrecognised surface takes the write shape and renders.
/// A row is data from a database several stations write to; refusing to draw
/// one is how a page goes blank on the day somebody upgrades one panel, and an
/// audit trail that lies by omission is the one failure mode it cannot have.
/// Phase 6 needs only to add its surface to `kKnownAuditSurfaces` and one
/// filter entry — no new chip either, because `admin` rows carry
/// `groupRequired: 'users'` and the existing `users` chip already covers them.
///
/// **3. The transition columns are the writer's problem, not this widget's.**
/// An `admin` row has no `old → new` pair in the ordinary sense — a role's
/// group set changing *is* the value — so the Phase 6 **writer** puts a
/// human-readable summary in `oldValue` and `newValue` (a `role.update` writes
/// something like `"operate, users"` → `"operate"`), and this widget renders
/// whatever is there, applying the same em-dash rule when either is null. The
/// alternative — teaching this widget what `role.*` keys mean by switching on
/// `itemKey` prefixes — is the exact coupling the open-vocabulary rule exists
/// to prevent. A Phase 6 executor who finds these columns empty should fix the
/// writer, not this file.
