/// truth table can pin exhaustively.
///
/// The checks run in one order and the order is load-bearing: [AccessGroup
/// .operate] first, then the repository, then the session. Checking the session
/// first would let an unavailable-repository station resolve on a session that
/// has no authority behind it — a stale in-memory session claiming `configure`
/// after the database it was resolved against went away.
///
/// **No repository, one door opens.** With no repository, `signIn` can only
/// answer `AccessSignInResult.unavailable` (`lib/providers/access.dart`), so a
/// locked Server Config would be a sign-in prompt that cannot be passed,
/// guarding the page where the database is configured. That is true whether the
/// station was never configured or somebody mistyped the Postgres IP and saved
/// — and the second is the case that matters, because without this a typo turns
/// into an on-site recovery. `PROJECT.md` is explicit that the realistic failure
/// here is accident and shift confusion, not a malicious insider. So
/// [allowWhenRepositoryUnavailable] is passed true for exactly one route
/// (`kServerConfigRoute`) and false everywhere else.
///
/// **No repository, the other five stay shut.** The argument above is entirely
/// about reaching the database configuration page. It says nothing about Page
/// Editor, Alarm Editor, Key Repository, IP Settings or Preferences —
/// `centroid-hmi/lib/navigation.dart:48-50` already calls those surfaces that
/// store secrets — and an outage is a state a commissioned station enters
/// mid-shift, inducible from a Save button. Opening them would hand every gated
/// route to whoever is standing at the panel for the length of it.
///
/// **Loading is neither.** `AsyncLoading` is [AccessGateState.waiting], so a
/// slow connection is never mistaken for a missing one.
///
/// **The cost, accepted deliberately:** an unreachable database leaves Server
/// Config reachable by anyone at the panel, so someone could repoint the station
/// at a Postgres they control holding a known Engineering account and sign in.
/// That takes physical access to the panel plus a prepared server, and physical
/// access already defeats this milestone by design — spec §8, anyone with
/// UaExpert or `psql` walks around every guard. Bricking a plant's station over
/// a typo is the likelier and worse failure.
///
/// The parameter is named for the condition it enforces. It is deliberately not
/// `allowWhenUnconfigured`: it fires on *any* unavailable repository,
/// unconfigured or unreachable alike, and a name claiming the narrower condition
/// would be the same defect class as a mitigation sentence that describes its
/// own hole. There is likewise no provider anywhere in this phase that
/// distinguishes the two causes — under this ruling it would discriminate
/// nothing.
