/// The access templates, in memory, and the two ways to ask what they say.
///
/// 04-01 built the resolver, 04-03 built the store, 04-04 taught the guard to
/// ask one question per changed member. This file is the connection: it loads
/// `access_template` and `access_key_binding` into one snapshot, hands
/// `accessPolicyProvider` a callback onto it, and gives widgets the same
/// answer without an await.
///
/// **The shape, and why it is this shape.** Four providers, of which exactly
/// one holds state and exactly one can be invalidated:
///
/// | Provider | Rebuilds when | Read by |
/// |---|---|---|
/// | [tagBindingResolverProvider] | never | the policy, the loader, [tagAccessProvider] |
/// | [accessTemplateStoreProvider] | the database changes | the loader, 04-07, 04-09 |
/// | [accessTemplatesProvider] | invalidated after a write | the key-repository UI |
/// | [tagAccessProvider] | a sign-in, or a load | widgets |
///
/// Everything downstream of the plant connection hangs off the first row, and
/// the first row has no dependencies at all. That is what lets a template edit
/// change what the guard answers without costing an OPC UA connection.
///
/// **What this file deliberately does not do.** It registers no listener on
/// the preferences change stream. Bindings used to live on `KeyMappingEntry`,
/// inside the key-mapping blob, and a save of that blob was how a binding
/// changed; the 2026-08-30 ruling moved them into their own table, because a
/// binding is authorization data and the key-mapping preference is
/// `configure`-classified. So a key-mapping save can no longer change a
/// binding, and there is nothing here to subscribe to. `state_man.dart` next
/// door *does* listen, which is why the absence is written down: it would
/// otherwise read as an oversight. `access_templates_test.dart` asserts it as
/// a grep (T-04-28) rather than trusting this paragraph.
///
/// **The orphan this leaves, named rather than swept.** A key removed from the
/// key mappings leaves its binding row behind. Nothing here cleans that up.
/// The row is harmless — `unboundKeys` never sees the key, because the key
/// list no longer contains it — and deleting rows on a key-mapping save would
/// be an unaudited `users`-grade write triggered by a `configure`-grade
/// action, which is exactly the confusion the ruling removed. 04-08 surfaces
/// orphans; it does not sweep them either.

/// ## Why this is a `keepAlive` provider holding a mutable object
///
/// The obvious shape for this is `FutureProvider<AccessPolicy>` — load the
/// templates, build a policy from them, hand it out. Do not do that, and this
/// paragraph is here to stop the next person who tries.
///
/// `lib/providers/state_man.dart` reads [accessPolicyProvider] once, with
/// `ref.read`, to build the `GuardedStateMan` that owns **every OPC UA
/// connection and every subscription on the panel**. If the policy became a
/// value that changes when the templates change, then editing a template — or
/// binding one key, or a Postgres reconnect that reloads the snapshot — would
/// invalidate the policy, rebuild `stateManProvider`, and drop the plant
/// connection. Operators would see the whole screen go stale because somebody
/// in the office renamed a template.
///
/// `guard_wiring_test.dart`'s *"signing in and out does not rebuild
/// stateManProvider"* is the test that stops being true, and T-04-25 is the
/// threat. So the policy is handed a **callback** — `groupFor` on this object —
/// and this object never changes identity. Its snapshot is replaced in place
/// by [accessTemplatesProvider]. 04-01's `identical()` test exists for exactly
/// this, and there is a matching one here.
///
/// The provider therefore has **no dependencies**: nothing can invalidate it,
/// so nothing can rebuild it, so nothing downstream of it rebuilds either.
/// That is the property, and it is worth the mutable object.
///
/// ## Why it kicks the loader
///
/// Having no dependencies is what creates the hole the kick below closes. See
/// the comment at the kick; it is the reason this plan exists.

  // The kick. Nothing in the design above makes the load happen, and that is
  // the hole.
  //
  // Every consumer reads *this* provider rather than the loader: the policy
  // takes a callback onto it, `tagAccessProvider` reads it, and neither
  // depends on `accessTemplatesProvider`. So without this line a station with
  // templates created and keys bound comes up with an empty snapshot,
  // `groupFor` answers null for every one of them, `guarded_state_man.dart`
  // permits every write, and the panel is byte-identically indistinguishable
  // from one nobody ever configured — silently, with every test passing.
  // Worse, the only thing that would have started the load is opening
  // `/advanced/key-repository`, which is also the only page that surfaces
  // unbound keys: bindings would have taken effect only for the person looking
  // at the screen that reports them missing.
  //
  // Forced from here rather than from a caller so that no caller can forget
  // it. The idiom is `state_man.dart`'s `ref.read(collectorProvider.future)` —
  // an unawaited read whose value nobody wants, whose purpose is that the
  // provider runs. It is scheduled rather than called inline because this
  // provider is mid-build and the loader reads it back.
  //
  // **One-way on purpose.** The resolver starts the load; the load never
  // rebuilds the resolver. Making `accessPolicyProvider` depend on the loader
  // is the obvious alternative and it is the one thing this design forbids: it
  // would rebuild the policy on every template edit, rebuild
  // `stateManProvider`, and drop every OPC UA connection on the panel.

/// sign-in, ever, because rebuilding it drops every OPC UA subscription on the

/// callback, and this one watches it. Do not "fix" the inconsistency by making
/// them match; fixing it in the wrong direction is T-04-30.
///
/// While the session is still loading this resolves on [kSessionWhileLoading],
/// the same conservative floor both guards use, so a control never renders
/// unlocked and then locks a frame later (T-04-29).
///
/// It also watches [accessTemplatesProvider] — for the rebuild, not the value.
/// Binding a key has to take the lock off, or put it on, without the operator
/// navigating away and back. That watch is safe here for the same reason it
/// would be fatal in `accessPolicyProvider`: nothing that holds a connection
