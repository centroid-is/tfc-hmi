/// The one live binding snapshot on the panel.
///
/// ## Why this is a `keepAlive` provider holding a mutable object
///
/// The obvious shape for this is `FutureProvider<AccessPolicy>` — load the
/// templates, build a policy from them, hand it out. Do not do that, and this
/// paragraph is here to stop the next person who tries.
///
/// `lib/providers/state_man.dart` reads [accessPolicyProvider] once, with
/// `ref.read`, to build the `GuardedStateMan` that owns **every OPC UA
/// connection and every subscription on the panel**. If the policy became a
/// value that changes when the templates change, then editing a template — or
/// binding one key, or a Postgres reconnect that reloads the snapshot — would
/// invalidate the policy, rebuild `stateManProvider`, and drop the plant
/// connection. Operators would see the whole screen go stale because somebody
/// in the office renamed a template.
///
/// `guard_wiring_test.dart`'s *"signing in and out does not rebuild
/// stateManProvider"* is the test that stops being true, and T-04-25 is the
/// threat. So the policy is handed a **callback** — `groupFor` on this object —
/// and this object never changes identity. Its snapshot is replaced in place
/// by [accessTemplatesProvider]. 04-01's `identical()` test exists for exactly
/// this, and there is a matching one here.
///
/// The provider therefore has **no dependencies**: nothing can invalidate it,
/// so nothing can rebuild it, so nothing downstream of it rebuilds either.
/// That is the property, and it is worth the mutable object.
///
/// ## Why it kicks the loader
///
/// Having no dependencies is what creates the hole the kick below closes. See
/// the comment at the kick; it is the reason this plan exists.
///

/// [TagAccess] for the session in force, rebuilt when that session changes.
///
/// ## Why this watches the session where the store must not
///
/// The asymmetry is deliberate and looks like an inconsistency until it is
/// stated, so: a **widget** must rebuild on sign-in — the moment the operator
/// is allowed through a control, the lock has to come off without waiting for
/// anything else to happen. The **plant connection** must not rebuild on
/// sign-in, ever, because rebuilding it drops every OPC UA subscription on the
/// panel. `accessTemplateStoreProvider` above therefore takes the session as a
/// callback, and this one watches it. Do not "fix" the inconsistency by making
/// them match; fixing it in the wrong direction is T-04-30.
///
/// While the session is still loading this resolves on [kSessionWhileLoading],
/// the same conservative floor both guards use, so a control never renders
/// unlocked and then locks a frame later (T-04-29).
///
/// It also watches [accessTemplatesProvider] — for the rebuild, not the value.
/// Binding a key has to take the lock off, or put it on, without the operator
/// navigating away and back. That watch is safe here for the same reason it
/// would be fatal in `accessPolicyProvider`: nothing that holds a connection
/// reads this provider.
