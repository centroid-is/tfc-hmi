/// The seam between the administration screen and 06-03's store: one provider
/// that reaches the store, and two that feed the page its lists.
///
/// It is deliberately thin. Every question about permission, every audit row
/// and every invariant lives below this file — in `AccessAdminStore` and, for
/// the last-`users`-holder rule, in `AccessRepository`'s transaction. What is
/// here is wiring, and the value of writing it once is that 06-07 and 06-08 —
/// the roles section and the users section, written in parallel — reach the
/// same store through the same three names.
///
/// **Nothing in this file polls.** There is no periodic timer, no stream over
/// the authorization tables and no `ref.listen` on the session. Both lists are
/// refreshed by `ref.invalidate` from the caller after a write, which is the
/// convention `access_templates.dart` set and Phase 5 restated. A subscription
/// would put a listener on a database that has no change feed configured for
/// these two tables — one that would never fire and would still have to be torn
/// down.
///
/// **The other half of a role write lives next door.** Invalidating
/// [accessAdminRolesProvider] refreshes the *list*; it does not change what the
/// running app permits. `AccessSessionController.refreshGroupsFromRoles` is
/// what does that, and the roles section calls both. See that method's own doc
/// for why the `Operator` banner is otherwise a promise the screen does not
/// keep.

/// Null is a normal state, not an error, exactly as it is for
/// [accessRepositoryProvider]: no Postgres configured, and again during the
/// boot window before the connection opens. The page renders that as a terminal
/// state; nothing here throws for it.
///
/// The session is a **callback**, `sessionInForce(ref)`, and never a watch. A
/// watch here would rebuild this provider — and with it the repository handle
/// it holds — on every sign-in, sign-out and inactivity timeout (T-04-30), and
/// it would not even buy anything: `AccessAdminStore` resolves the session per

/// `keepAlive: true` for the same reason `accessTemplateStoreProvider` is: it
/// holds a handle, and rebuilding it every time somebody opens the screen would
