/// The unchecked write path, for the defaults the app writes for itself.

/// **This is not "writes we want to allow".** It is "writes the app makes on
/// its own behalf when nobody has acted" — a config default written because
/// storage is empty. A Save button never qualifies, however inconvenient its
/// denial is; the fix for a legitimate operator write being refused is a rule
/// in `kPrefAccessRules`, not a call to this provider.
///
/// Every write through it still produces one audit row, marked `origin:
/// 'system'`. The set of files that may read this provider is capped by
/// [kSystemWriteCallSites] and by a test that compares that constant against
/// the source in both directions.
///
/// Falls back to the guarded object when `preferencesProvider` has been
/// overridden with something that is not a [GuardedPreferences], which is what
/// a test that overrides the store gets. A cast would turn that into a crash
/// in every such test for no gain.
