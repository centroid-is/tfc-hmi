/// **Why the carry-over exists.** Until this provider took the injected
/// preferences, `collector_config` was written straight to the device's own
/// preferences file. [shared] is the database-backed store, and its
/// in-memory cache is seeded by `loadFromPostgres()` — never by
/// `_loadFromLocalCache()` — whenever the database is up, which is the only
/// case this function is called in. So a station whose config is only in the
/// device file reads `null` here, and without the carry-over would be handed a
/// **default**: a collector station silently demoted to one that records
/// nothing. `collector_config_migration_test.dart`'s first group proves that
/// premise rather than assuming it.
///
/// The order is the one `migrateMcpConfigToDeviceLocal` established: read the
/// device blob **first**, then the shared one, then write. The two stores share
/// a physical file — the device store is the shared store's local cache — so a
/// write to [shared] mirrors into [local], and reading [local] afterwards would
/// be reading back what was just written.
///
/// [systemWrites] is the unchecked path, and both writes here take it: they run
/// at boot with nobody signed in, and `collector_config` requires `administer`.
/// It skips the denial, not the audit — each write still lands in the trail
/// marked `origin: 'system'`.
