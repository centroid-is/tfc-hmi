/// That pairing is the whole reason plan 01-04 built the monitor the way it
/// did. An always-on `Timer.periodic` in shared plumbing has failed unrelated
/// widget tests in this repo before: a pending timer at the end of a
/// `testWidgets` body fails the test even when the widget under test never
/// touched the thing that armed it. A future refactor that subscribes
/// unconditionally in [build] reintroduces exactly that, and
/// `test/providers/access_session_test.dart` has tests whose only job is to
/// fail if it does.

/// ## `expiresAt` is the authority, the timer is only a prompt
///
/// Pausing the countdown must not extend the session. Every re-attach compares
/// `clock.now()` against `expiresAt` first and expires immediately if it has
/// passed; otherwise it arms for the time *remaining* via
