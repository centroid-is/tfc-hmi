/// The `users`-gated CRUD over `app_role` and `app_user`, or null when this
/// station has no database.
///
/// Null is a normal state, not an error, exactly as it is for
/// [accessRepositoryProvider]: no Postgres configured, and again during the
/// boot window before the connection opens. The page renders that as a terminal
/// state; nothing here throws for it.
///
/// The session is a **callback**, `sessionInForce(ref)`, and never a watch. A
/// watch here would rebuild this provider — and with it the repository handle
/// it holds — on every sign-in, sign-out and inactivity timeout (T-04-30), and
/// it would not even buy anything: `AccessAdminStore` resolves the session per
/// operation precisely so a store built while anonymous is the same store that
/// permits the write a second later. `access_admin_test.dart` proves that with
/// an `identical` assertion across a sign-in rather than trusting this
/// paragraph.
///
/// `keepAlive: true` for the same reason `accessTemplateStoreProvider` is: it
/// holds a handle, and rebuilding it every time somebody opens the screen would
/// re-derive that handle for nothing.
///
/// Copied from [accessAdminStore].

///
/// An empty list when there is no store, rather than a throw. "No database" and
/// "no roles" are different claims and the section says which it is from the
/// store provider's own value; what this list must not do is turn a station
/// commissioned without Postgres into an error box.

/// A store failure *is* propagated — an unreadable roster must not render as an
/// empty one, because an empty roles list is a claim about the tables that
