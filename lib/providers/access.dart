  /// Re-resolve the session in force against `app_role` and `app_user`, in

  ///
  /// ## Who calls this, and why it is not optional
  ///
  /// Two call sites, both on the administration screen:
  ///
  /// * **After any role write** (06-07). The roles section puts a banner on the
  ///   `Operator` row saying that ticking a group there grants it to every
  ///   logged-out panel on the floor. `AccessRepository.anonymousGroups()` is
  ///   what resolves that claim, and until this method existed its only callers
  ///   were [_anonymousGroups] — reached at build, at restore and at sign-out.
  ///   So without this call the banner warns about a change the app does not
  ///   apply until something else happens to rebuild the session, which is
  ///   worse than no banner: it is a promise the screen does not keep.
  /// * **After any user write that can change the caller's own privileges**,
  ///   which is `setUserRole` and `deleteUser` (06-08). CONTEXT's lockout
  ///   invariant is "at least one account holds a role granting `users`", not
  ///   "you may not edit yourself", so an admin may demote or delete their own
  ///   account whenever a second holder exists.
  ///
  /// ## The elevated arm re-reads the row, never the cached name
  ///
  /// It resolves [AccessRepository.user] for the signed-in username **first**,
  /// and then resolves *that row's* `roleName`. Resolving the name the session
  /// already carries is one call shorter and wrong: that name is exactly what a
  /// role change writes over, so it would answer the old role and the method
  /// would silently fail in the one case it exists for.
  ///
  /// The username is compared exactly. `app_user.username` is a case-sensitive
  /// primary key and `user('JON')` deliberately does not find `jon`; nothing
  /// here folds.
  ///
  /// ## Three routes down to anonymous
  ///
  /// The `app_user` row has disappeared — the account was deleted, possibly by
  /// its own holder; the row's role cannot be resolved — deleted or renamed;
  /// or the repository is unreachable, so neither can be confirmed. A session
  /// whose account no longer exists is not an elevated session, and leaving it
  /// holding `users` is the privilege-retention hole this method exists to
  /// close.
  ///
  /// Each of the three does what [signOut] and [_expire] already do on the way
  /// down: `_detach()`, then `_clearStoredSession()`, then [_toAnonymous].
  ///
  /// * The **detach** is not decoration. [_attach] early-returns at
  ///   `if (_expiry != null)`, so a live subscription left behind would make
  ///   the next sign-in's `monitor.arm(remaining)` never run, and the new
  ///   operator would count down the dropped session's leftover remainder until
  ///   their first pointer-down re-armed it. That is bounded and fail-safe — an
  ///   early logout, not a retained privilege — which is why it is worth one
  ///   line and not worth a workaround.
  /// * The **clear** is the difference between closing the hole and closing it
  ///   until the next restart. [_restoreOrAnonymous] resolves the *stored*
  ///   payload's role name and never consults `app_user`, so a payload left
  ///   behind by a self-delete restores **elevated**, with the deleted
  ///   account's name and the old role's groups, on any start inside the
  ///   remaining window. [poke] would not overwrite it either: it returns early
  ///   on a non-elevated session.
  ///
  /// ## What it must not do
  ///
  /// It does not call [poke] — an admin saving a role in another tab is not the
  /// signed-in operator touching the panel, and quietly extending a session
  /// because somebody re-saved a role is an inactivity timeout that does not
  /// time out. It does not change `expiresAt`. It **never attaches** the
  /// inactivity monitor; the anonymous arm and the surviving-elevated arm
  /// attach and detach nothing.
  ///
  /// It writes **no audit row**. `audit.dart`'s four auth itemKeys are `login`,
  /// `login_failed`, `logout` and `session_timeout`, and re-resolving groups is
  /// none of them; the role write itself is already recorded by
  /// `AccessAdminStore` as `role.update`, with the group sets as `old → new`. A
  /// second row here would be one action producing two unrelated rows.
  ///
  /// It has exactly **two** permitted device-local persistence writes, and they
  /// are named together so a later reader does not take either for an
  /// oversight:
  ///
  /// 1. `_clearStoredSession()` on the three drop routes above.
  /// 2. [_persist] of the newly published session on the **demotion** route —
  ///    the row still exists and its role still resolves, but its `role_name`
  ///    differs from the one the session was carrying — **with the same
  ///    `expiresAt` the session already had**. Here the session stays elevated,
  ///    so no drop route fires and nothing clears the payload, while the stored
  ///    copy keeps the old, wider role name; a restart inside the remaining
  ///    window would restore through `_roleOrNull(repo, stored.roleName)` with
  ///    the groups the demotion just removed. Carrying the existing `expiresAt`
  ///    through unchanged is what keeps "never rewrite a stored `expiresAt`"
  ///    intact: this rewrites the role, not the clock.
  ///
  /// A no-op after dispose, like [_toAnonymous].
