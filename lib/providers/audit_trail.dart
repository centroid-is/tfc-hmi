/// Three providers, and the whole of Phase 2's unavailable-versus-empty ruling

///
/// | Provider | Lifetime | Answers |
/// |---|---|---|
/// | [auditTrailStoreProvider] | `keepAlive` | a store, or **null** when this station has no database |
/// | [auditTrailEntriesProvider] | autoDispose family | one [AuditQuery] as one [AuditTrailResult], or **null** |
/// | [auditWhoOptionsProvider] | autoDispose | the `who` dropdown's options |
///
/// **Refresh is `ref.invalidate`, and this file starts no timer.** That is
/// CONTEXT's ruling and it has a reason: an always-on `Timer.periodic` in this
/// repo's plumbing has broken unrelated widget tests, and a self-scrolling
/// audit list is unreadable while you are trying to read a row. The deferred
/// list already records the live-update design that was offered and not taken
/// (a listener-gated 30s poll showing "N new entries — tap to load"); if it is
/// ever built it must be listener-gated — started in `onListen`, stopped in
/// `onCancel` — and not a bare periodic. `audit_trail_test.dart` asserts the
/// absence on the source text rather than trusting this paragraph.

/// would rebuild the database handle — and with it every OPC UA subscription on
/// the panel — on every sign-in. Nothing of the sort is true here. This feeds
/// one page and nothing else, so holding a query result after the page is gone
/// is a cache nobody reads and a handle held on behalf of nobody.
/// `tagAccessProvider` in that same file is the plain `@riverpod` shape this
/// copies; the family argument is the only thing this one adds.
///
/// ## Null, error and empty are three answers
///
/// Null means the trail is **unavailable** — no database. An error means the
/// database was there and the read failed, which the page also renders as
/// unavailable, and which must not be swallowed here: "nothing matched" is a
/// claim about the plant's history and a failed read is not entitled to make
/// it. An [AuditTrailResult] with no actions means the query ran and matched
/// nothing.
///
/// ## Refresh
///
/// `ref.invalidate(auditTrailEntriesProvider)`, from the page's refresh action.
/// Nothing here polls; see the library doc for why, and for what a future
/// live-update hook would have to look like instead.
