/// who can edit a page could re-scope the rules that govern the plant.

/// The same reasoning `guarded_history_views.dart` writes at

/// a rule to `kPrefAccessRules`.
///
/// ## The one thing this store must not do
///
/// It never touches the key-mapping preference blob. Not to read a key list,
/// not to validate a key name, not as a convenience. Key mappings are a
/// `configure`-gated preference and this store is the `users` boundary; a read
/// would be harmless and a write would be the hole the 2026-08-30 ruling
/// closed, so a grep gate forbids that preference key's literal name anywhere
/// in this file — including in a comment, which is why this paragraph spells
/// it out in prose. The boundary is then trivially checkable. Do not add one.
