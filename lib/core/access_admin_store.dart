/// Every write to `app_role` and `app_user`, behind one object and one gate.
///
/// A role decides what a group of people may do; an account decides which
/// person is in that group. Both are the authorization data itself, which is
/// why spec §1 puts them behind `users` rather than `administer` — `administer`
/// is server config, database, network and updates, which is station plumbing,
/// not who may do what.
///
/// This is the closure of the write-path sweep's §3.3 entry, which records
/// `AccessRepository` writing both tables through raw Drift as the one write
/// path deliberately left open, with *"Phase 6 gates it on `users`"* as the
/// closing condition. Plan 06-06 annotates the sweep once this holds.
///
/// ## Why the group is declared here rather than looked up
///
/// The same reasoning `access_template_store.dart` writes at
/// [kAccessTemplateGroup] and `guarded_history_views.dart` at
/// `kHistoryViewDeleteGroup`: neither table is a preference key, this store
/// consults no policy table, and a second source for one answer drifts. If you
/// are here to change what is gated, change [kAccessAdminGroup]; do not add a
/// rule to `kPrefAccessRules`.
///
/// ## The one thing this store must not do
///
/// It offers no delete, no prune and no export over `audit_entry`. The trail is
/// append-only, that property is currently enforced by absence, and this is the
/// file where somebody would first be tempted to break it — "clean up the rows
/// of the account I just deleted" is exactly the wrong instinct.
/// `audit_entry.who` is a denormalised TEXT column with no foreign key so that
/// a deleted account's rows survive it by construction. Do not add a cascade,
/// and do not add a method here that touches the trail.

/// distinct strings, so a Phase 5 filter for one does not drag in the other.
/// That is the same idea `access_template_store.dart` applies one level down
/// with its `access_template.` / `access_key_binding.` prefixes.
///
/// ## Design decision 1: repository below, store above
///
/// No other file in this tree has both layers, and the split is deliberate
/// rather than incidental. `AccessTemplateStore` owns its Drift queries with
/// nothing beneath it; this store cannot, because `db.transaction` and the
/// last-`users`-holder invariant have to live in `packages/tfc_dart`, which has
/// no notion of an [AccessSession] and no [AuditSink] wiring. So:
///
/// * **The transaction, and every invariant that must be evaluated inside it,
///   live in [AccessRepository].** That is the only reason the repository layer
///   exists here. The lockout rule is not re-implemented in this file — it has
///   one home, and this store surfaces its refusal.
/// * **The permission question, the audit row and the required-group constant
///   live here.** [kAccessAdminGroup] is a store-layer fact: it is the gate
///   *this store* asks.
/// * **This store holds no `AppDatabase` and imports no Drift.** Its reads go
///   through the repository too, which turns "pages never touch Drift" into a
///   greppable property one layer higher — this file's Drift import count is
///   zero, and a test asserts it. A method that needs a `Value()` or a
///   `Companion` belongs in the repository, not here.
/// * **Pages talk to this store and to nothing else.** They never hold an
///   [AccessRepository].
///
/// ## Design decision 2: where the audit row goes, relative to the guard
/// inside the transaction
///
/// `AccessTemplateStore` records the allowed row **before** its statement, on
/// the principle that a delete of a template keys still name changed nothing
/// and must leave no row claiming it did. It can do that because every one of
/// its preconditions is checkable in the store. This store's lockout invariant
/// is exactly the one that is not: it is evaluated inside the repository's
/// transaction, which is precisely the condition this layer cannot pre-check
/// without reintroducing the race it was moved down there to close.
///
/// Three options, and the choice:
///
/// * **(iii) Write the audit row inside the same transaction — rejected.**
///   `DriftAuditSink` has one method and its test greps the source to keep it
///   that way; the Postgres audit role is INSERT-only into `audit_entry`, so a
///   row enlisted in an application transaction that later rolls back is
///   silently discarded — the opposite of what an append-only trail is for. It
///   would also couple every future sink, including a remote one over the relay
///   pipe, to Drift's transaction.
/// * **(ii) Pre-check in the store, guard again in the transaction, and record
///   before the statement — rejected.** A lost race writes a row for a write
///   that was then refused. That is a *false* row, and the whole value of the
///   trail is that every row in it is true.
/// * **(i) Record the permitted row after the repository call returns —
///   chosen.** The one window it leaves is a crash between `COMMIT` and the
///   sink call, which costs one true row. That is the failure mode the sink
///   already has and already logs as `AUDIT ROW LOST`. Given the choice between
///   possibly losing a true row and possibly writing a false one, lose the true
///   one.
///
/// **Denial rows keep the template store's ordering — recorded before the
/// throw** — because a deny row is the only evidence the guard fired and there
/// is nothing written for it to contradict. So the full order of every write in
/// this file is:
///
/// gate → (denied: record the deny row, call `onDenied`, throw) → call the
/// repository → (the repository threw [LastUsersHolderException],
/// [RoleInUseException], [UserExistsException], [UserNotFoundException],
/// [MissingRoleError] or [ProtectedRoleError]: record **nothing**, rethrow) →
/// record the allowed row.
///
/// If you move a `_recordAllowed` call above its repository call, five named
/// tests in `access_admin_store_test.dart` stop passing. They are there because
/// that is the edit somebody will make while tidying.
