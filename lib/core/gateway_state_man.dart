/// `StateMan`, but every value comes down one WebSocket.
///
/// **Why an adapter exists at all.** The milestone's premise is that
/// `StateManApi` is one interface implemented by both sides and widgets do not
/// change. Half of that is true: `RemoteStateMan` and `LocalStateMan` both
/// implement `StateManApi` (`packages/tfc_relay_protocol`). The other half is
/// not, and it is worth writing down rather than discovering twice —
/// **`tfc_dart`'s `StateMan`, which is the type this app's widgets actually
/// hold, does not implement `StateManApi` and never has.** They are two
/// interfaces:
///
///  * They disagree on the three methods they share. `StateMan.read` is
///    `Future<DynamicValue>`; `StateManApi.read` is a synchronous
///    `DynamicValue?` (cache peek) with the round trip on `readFresh`.
///    `StateMan.subscribe` returns `Future<Stream<…>>`; the API's returns a
///    `Stream<…>` synchronously. `StateMan.write` takes a `DynamicValue` and
///    returns `Future<void>`; the API's takes an `Object?` with `expect`/`cmd`
///    and returns a three-state `WriteResult`.
///  * They disagree on the value type. `StateMan` speaks
///    `package:open62541`'s `DynamicValue`; the protocol package defines its
///    own, deliberately, so that the gateway and a future web client never
///    pull in open62541's native assets. Every value crossing this class is
///    translated, the mirror of `tfc_relay_local`'s `translateOpcUaSample`.
///  * `StateMan` has fourteen members the API does not: `config`,
///    `keyMappings`, `updateKeyMappings`, `clients`, `deviceClients`,
///    `resolveKey`, `setSubstitution`, `getSubstitution`, `substitutions`,
///    `substitutionsChanged`, `isKeyDisabled`, `connMetaAliases`,
///    `subscribeConnMeta`, `close`. App code calls all of them.
///
/// So this class is what "widgets do not change" costs on this codebase: it
/// `implements StateMan` — the same trick `GuardedStateMan` already uses, and
/// the reason `stateManProvider`'s type does not move — and satisfies each of
/// those fourteen either locally or by documented refusal.
///
/// **What it cannot do, stated once here rather than discovered on a panel.**
///
///  * **Subscriptions are fixed at construction.** `RemoteStateMan` takes its
///    key set as a constructor argument and the supervisor re-establishes
///    exactly that set on every reconnect; the class exposes no way to add a
///    key later, and its `subscribe(key)` only hands back a view of a store
///    node that the fixed subscription feeds. This adapter therefore subscribes
///    to **every key in `key_mappings`** up front. On a station whose mapping
///    is the whole plant that is a large subscription, and it is the honest
///    reading of the API as it stands — the alternative is a page whose values
///    never arrive, silently.
///  * **`clients` and `deviceClients` are empty.** They hand out live OPC UA
///    and Modbus client objects, and in gateway mode this process holds
///    neither. The eleven call sites are all browse/diagnostic UI —
///    `opcua_browse`, `umas_browse`, `opcua_array_index_field`, the Schneider
///    asset's raw node read, the server-config live-status chip and the MCP
///    node browser — so those degrade to "nothing to show" rather than
///    misreport. `RemoteStateMan` does expose a `browse` sub-API over the wire;
///    wiring the browse widgets to it is a follow-up, not this class's job.
///  * **Substitution is local, and that is correct.** `StateManApi`'s own doc
///    keeps `$variable` resolution off the wire. This class reimplements
///    `StateMan`'s resolver against its own map, so `OptionVariable` and the
///    timeseries mixin behave the same on both transports.
