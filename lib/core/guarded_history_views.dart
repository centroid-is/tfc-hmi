/// The history view's write guard — spec §6's fourth bypass, closed at the
/// controls.
///
/// `lib/pages/history_view.dart` reached Drift directly at five places, through
/// two different accessors (`adb` and `dbWrap.db`, which is why a grep for one
/// never found the other). None of them passed `StateMan.write` or
/// `PreferencesApi.set*`, so neither `GuardedStateMan` nor `GuardedPreferences`
/// could ever see them. This is the third surface: a store that holds all five
/// writes, checks the two destructive ones, and records every one.
///
/// ## Why this is not fixed at the route
///
/// `/advanced/history-view` is deliberately absent from `kRaisedRoutes`, and
/// must stay absent. Spec §11 defers read permissions on trends and history on
/// purpose, and reading history is operate-level work — an operator looking at
/// last night's shift is doing their job. The defect Phase 2 found is a
/// *destructive control* on a page that should stay readable, so the fix
/// belongs at the control. `guarded_history_views_test.dart` asserts the route
/// is still not raised, so that claim is checked rather than remembered.
///
/// ## Why the group is declared here rather than looked up
///
/// This store consults no policy table. The group is [kHistoryViewDeleteGroup],
/// a constant in this file — the route-style declaration spec §7 uses for a
/// surface whose items are not preference keys. A `history_view.` entry in
/// `kPrefAccessRules` would be a *second* source for one answer, and the two
/// would drift. If you are here to change what is gated, change the two
/// constants below; do not add a rule elsewhere.
