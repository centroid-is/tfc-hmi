/// that decides how far back a query reaches, and one store object that turns
/// the result into one bounded newest-first statement.
///
/// Nothing in the tree selected from `audit_entry` before this file. The table
/// has had exactly one writer since Phase 1 — `DriftAuditSink` — and this is
/// its counterpart on the read side.
///
/// ## Why the query is built here rather than as a method on `AppDatabase`
///
/// Pages never touch Drift, and neither does anything else outside a store —
/// that was Phase 3's bypass-4 defect (`history_view.dart:1108`). Putting the
/// query on `AppDatabase` would put a second place to look for it and would
/// spend a `tfc_dart` release on a statement only this page issues. The typed
/// builder compiles to SQLite and Postgres alike, so the in-memory test
/// exercises the real statement rather than a stand-in for it.
///
/// ## Why the reads are ungated and unaudited
///
/// `access_template_store.dart`'s class doc is the binding precedent: *"Reads …
/// are ungated and unaudited: looking at the rules is not an authorization
/// change, and a row per render would bury the writes that matter."* That
/// applies with more force here. A store-level guard on this read would write a
/// row into the trail every time somebody scrolled the trail, and the trail
/// would fill with people looking at it.
///
/// The enforcement is the **route** gate —
/// `kRaisedRoutes['/advanced/audit-trail'] = AccessGroup.users`.
/// [kAuditTrailGroup] exists in this file so that the route and the store name
/// the same word once.

  /// for the first row that breaks the coincidence.
  ///
  /// ## Empty selection means no constraint
  ///
  /// With [AuditQuery.groupNames] empty **and** [AuditQuery.includeAuth] false,
  /// no group predicate is emitted at all and every row matches. That is
  /// CONTEXT's locked decision, in its words: *"empty selection = no constraint.

  /// [kAuditTrailDefaultGroupNames] names the six non-`operate` groups and the
  /// auth flag is on, so the `operate` exclusion survives the rule intact.
  ///
  /// ## The key prefix and LIKE
  ///
  /// `%` and `_` typed by an operator act as LIKE wildcards. That widens the
  /// match and never narrows it, and it can never reach a row the group filter
  /// excluded, because the prefix clause is `AND`ed with every other one. The
  /// alternative — a hand-rolled `ESCAPE` clause — diverges between SQLite and
  /// Postgres, so this shape was chosen rather than overlooked.
