///
/// `docs/access-control-write-path-sweep.md` §3.1: `DriftTechDocIndex`,
/// `DriftPlcCodeIndex` and `DriftDrawingIndex` live in
/// `packages/tfc_mcp_server/lib/src/services/` and write Drift directly —
/// twenty-six statements between them. They were built for the MCP server, but
/// all three are wired into the Flutter app through providers
/// (`lib/providers/tech_doc.dart`, `lib/providers/plc.dart`,
/// `lib/providers/drawing.dart`) and their write methods are called from
/// `lib/tech_docs/tech_doc_upload_service.dart`,
/// `lib/tech_docs/tech_doc_library_section.dart` and
/// `lib/drawings/drawing_upload_service.dart`. None of it passed
/// `StateMan.write` or `PreferencesApi.set*`, so neither `GuardedStateMan` nor
/// `GuardedPreferences` could ever see it. An anonymous session at the panel
/// could delete a technical document and delete a PLC asset's index.
///
/// ## The decorator idiom, and why it fits here
///
/// All three Drift classes implement abstract interfaces, and every app-side
/// consumer is typed against the *interface* — `TechDocUploadService` holds a
/// `TechDocIndex`, `DrawingUploadService` holds a `DrawingIndex`. So wrapping
/// the three providers changes no call site at all, and the index classes
/// themselves are not touched: they are shared with the MCP server and this is
/// entirely app-side.
///
/// **Except for [PlcCodeIndexExtras]** — see its doc comment. That is the whole
/// risk of the change and the reason this file declares an interface as well as
/// three decorators.
///
/// ## Every member is forwarded by hand
///
/// There is no catch-all dispatch in this file, and
/// `test/core/guarded_knowledge_stores_test.dart` greps for it. Every member of
/// every interface is forwarded explicitly. Thirty forwards is tedious and the
/// tedium is the point: a catch-all decorator answers a member somebody forgot
/// to wire by throwing at runtime, on a plant, the first time it is called —
/// and the compiler, which would otherwise have refused the class outright,
/// says nothing. The same rule, for the same reason, as
/// `packages/tfc_dart/lib/core/access/guarded_state_man.dart`.
///
/// ## Why the group is declared here rather than looked up
///
/// These classes consult no policy table. The group is [kKnowledgeWriteGroup],
/// a constant in this file — the route-style declaration spec §7 uses for a
/// surface whose items are not preference keys, the same shape plan 03-10's
/// `HistoryViewStore` uses. A `tech_doc.` rule in `kPrefAccessRules` would be a
/// *second* source for one answer and the two would drift. If you are here to
/// change what is gated, change the constant below; do not add a rule
/// elsewhere.
///
/// ## The route is the other half
///
/// `/advanced/knowledge-base` is raised by plan 03-14. Neither half is
/// sufficient: the route gate keeps an anonymous session off the page, and
/// these guards are what refuse the write if any other path ever reaches them.

/// |---|---|
/// | `plcVarRefsForBlockProvider` | silently returns `[]` |
/// | `plcFbInstancesProvider` | silently returns `[]` |
/// | `plcBlockCallsProvider` | silently returns `[]` |
/// | `plcVarRefsProvider` | silently returns `[]` |
/// | `_reindexPlcAsset` in `tech_doc_library_section.dart` | shows "Re-index unavailable — database not connected", which would be a lie |
///
/// The first four are **reads** feeding the PLC detail panel, and they fail by
/// returning an empty list rather than by throwing. Wrapping the provider
/// without this interface turns the panel blank with no error anywhere — the
/// exact silent-breakage shape this phase exists to prevent, arriving through
/// the phase's own change. So the five type tests moved onto this interface and
/// the four providers have tests that were watched failing in between.
///
/// **[DriftPlcCodeIndex] does not implement this interface.** Dart is nominal:
/// declaring the same five signatures does not make the Drift class a
/// `PlcCodeIndexExtras`. [GuardedPlcCodeIndex] is the only implementer, and
/// after plan 03-13 the provider always returns the guard, so `is
/// PlcCodeIndexExtras` and "the app's PLC index" mean the same thing. That is

/// it. If some future code hands the raw Drift index to those providers again,
/// the type test fails and the panel goes blank — which is why
/// `knowledge_guard_wiring_test.dart` asserts what the provider returns.
///
/// `DriftPlcCodeIndex.getCallers` is a sixth extra member and is deliberately
/// **not** here: no app code calls it. Add it the day something does.
///
/// **It `implements PlcCodeIndex`** so that `is! PlcCodeIndexExtras` at the
