/// The audit surfaces this build knows how to talk about.
///
/// ## What this is for
///
/// It is the one place the surface vocabulary is written down, and it is a
/// **change-detector**. Exactly one assertion in
/// `test/core/audit_trail_grouping_test.dart` pins it. Add a surface and that
/// one test fails, in one file, with a message saying what to do about it.
///
/// ## What this is not for
///
/// It is **not** a whitelist. Nothing filters, drops, gates or branches on
/// membership in this set, and nothing may start to. A row whose `surface` is
/// not listed here flows through [groupAuditRows] untouched and is rendered by
/// the row widget's default branch, because it came from a station running a
/// newer build against the same database and the operator needs to see what
/// that station did. Dropping it would make the page lie by omission, which is
/// the one failure mode an audit trail cannot have.
///
/// ## Why it exists at all
///
/// It worked. Phase 6 added the fifth surface, `admin`, for role and user
/// administration — `itemKey`s `role.create` / `role.update` / `role.delete` /
/// `role.rename` and `user.create` / `user.delete` / `user.role` /
/// `user.password`, all carrying `groupRequired: 'users'` — and the whole cost
/// of that arriving was this one line and the one assertion that pins it.
/// `test/widgets/audit_trail_admin_surface_test.dart` proved beforehand, end to
/// end through the real store and the real reader, that the viewer renders an
/// `admin` row with no change of any kind: no new chip either, because the
/// existing `users` chip already covers rows carrying `groupRequired: 'users'`.
/// Nothing branched on membership then and nothing branches on it now.
const Set<String> kKnownAuditSurfaces = {'tag', 'pref', 'route', 'auth', 'admin'};

/// One human action and the rows of it this query could see.
///
/// Built only by [groupAuditRows], which never produces an empty [rows], so
/// [lead] is always safe.

  const AuditAction({
    required this.actionId,
    required this.rows,

  /// When the store did not supply a total this falls back to `rows.length` —

  /// span more than one call — a recipe apply that writes two keys is one
  /// action — and then the strings genuinely differ. Computing the maximum

/// ## Why this is map-based and not adjacency-based
///
/// `action_id` has no index, so grouping is client-side. Several SVN stations
/// share one database and rows come back ordered by `at`, so another station's
/// write landing between two members of a local struct write is routine rather
/// than exotic. Adjacency grouping would split that action in two, and neither
/// half would say so — it would render as two complete actions that each
/// under-report what happened.
///
/// ## Ordering
///
/// A plain `Map` is used and its iteration order is relied on: Dart's default
/// `Map` is a `LinkedHashMap` and iterates in key-insertion order. That is not
/// incidental — first-appearance order is the whole output contract. The input
/// is newest-first, so the output is newest-action-first, and no sort happens
/// here: the ordering rule lives in the store's `ORDER BY at DESC` and a second
/// copy of it would be a second thing to keep in step.
///
/// ## What this does not do
///
/// It does not filter. It receives what SQL returned and adds nothing back —
/// the reason [totalsByActionId] is passed in at all is that the excluded rows
/// are not available to be re-included.

///
/// `AccessGroup`'s declaration index, which is declared in increasing privilege
/// and is the single ranking in this codebase. This is
/// `guarded_state_man.dart`'s private `_strictest`, copied deliberately rather
/// than exposed by widening that file's API: it is three lines, and a second
/// ranking *table* would be a second thing to keep in step — which is the
/// defect that function's own comment warns about.
///
/// ## Why an unrecognised name is a real state and not a defensive flourish
///
/// The trail stores `group_required` as a **string**, and `AccessGroup.byName`
/// answers null for anything this build does not know. Its own doc says why: a
/// station running a newer build may have written a group name this one has
/// never heard of. Several SVN stations share one database, so on a
/// mixed-version site that is a row that exists.
///
/// So an unrecognised name loses to any recognised one, and when *every* name
/// is unrecognised the first is returned verbatim — the operator sees the
/// string the database actually holds, and the row is neither dropped nor
/// fatal.
///
/// There is deliberately no accessor here that turns an unknown name into
/// `operate`. Defaulting an unrecognised permission downward is exactly the
/// failure `byName`'s null return exists to prevent.
///
/// The empty string is not a group and never wins over one. An all-auth action
/// therefore yields the empty string: auth rows carry an empty `groupRequired`
/// because signing in is not gated on a group, and reporting `operate` for one
/// would be an invention.

///
/// 05-01's store selects its auth leg with `surface = 'auth'` and this function
/// recognises them with `surface == 'auth'` — the same column, the same value,
/// aligned on purpose. An earlier draft had the store keying on an empty
/// `group_required` while this keyed on `surface`. Those agree on every row in
/// the table today, which is precisely why nothing would have caught them
/// diverging: the row that breaks it is an unbound tag write, which carries an
/// empty `group_required` too (`guarded_state_man.dart` writes
/// `strictestRequired?.name ?? ''`).
