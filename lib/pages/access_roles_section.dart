/// The administration page's roles section — 06-CONTEXT "Roles Screen".
///
/// A list of roles, an editor with one labelled checkbox per group, and two
/// refusals that offer no way past themselves. Composed onto a page beside the
/// users section; this file renders a card and owns no route.
///
/// ## It is `users`-gated, and the gate is not in this file
///
/// Every write goes through [AccessAdminStore], which asks for
/// [kAccessAdminGroup] and records the answer either way. There is no second
/// path and no second gate. What this widget owes is legibility **before** the
/// operator presses anything, in the shape this milestone has used everywhere
/// else: visible, tappable, explained, never greyed. A control is not disabled
/// because the session may not use it — it is pressed, and the shared
/// `AccessDeniedPrompt` says which group to go and get.
///
/// ## The `Operator` row, and the one footgun this model creates
///
/// Anonymous **is** the role named `Operator`, by construction. So editing that
/// row changes what an *unauthenticated* panel may do: ticking a group there
/// grants it to every logged-out panel on the floor. That is allowed — it is
/// the knob a site turns when it wants a permissive line — and
/// `AccessRepository`'s class doc has asked since Phase 1 that "the Phase 6
/// roles screen must say so at the point of edit, not in a help page". The long
/// form of the argument is there; the same words appear in
/// `packages/tfc_access/lib/src/access_role.dart` and in
/// `docs/access-control-deployment.md` §5. This screen does not add a fourth
/// phrasing. It says the short version **twice**, because a banner alone is
/// read once and then ignored:
///
///  1. [kAccessOperatorBannerNote] — a persistent inline banner, rendered the
///     whole time the protected row's editor is open.
///  2. [kAccessOperatorConfirmMessage] — a confirmation on save, naming the
///     groups being added by their labels.
///
/// Both, always. Neither is conditional on the other, and each has its own
/// passing test.
///
/// ## A role write is not finished when the row is written
///
/// `ref.invalidate(accessAdminRolesProvider)` refreshes the *list*. What the
/// running app permits is re-resolved by
/// `AccessSessionController.refreshGroupsFromRoles`, and this section calls it
/// after **all four** role writes — create, update, rename and delete — not
/// only after an `Operator` edit. Deleting or re-scoping the role the signed-in
/// person holds is the same staleness with a different subject.
///
/// **That call goes last, and the ordering is load-bearing.** See [_afterWrite].
///
/// ## Two refusals, one dialog, and no override
///
/// A role delete can be blocked for two independent reasons: accounts still
/// hold it, and deleting it would leave nobody holding `users`. Both are
/// modelled as one state value ([_RoleDeleteBlock]) rather than two booleans,
/// because two booleans can both be true and then the dialog has to choose a
/// wording, which is exactly the drift this avoids. Neither refusal is an
/// `AccessDenied` and no sign-in resolves either, so while one is in force the
/// confirming action is **absent**, not greyed — `_DeleteTemplateDialog`'s
/// doctrine, quoted at [_DeleteRoleDialog].
///
/// There is no typed-confirmation escape, no control that deletes it anyway,
/// and no offer to move the holders elsewhere and then delete. 06-CONTEXT's
/// deferred list rejects the first and the last by name. The override phrasings
/// are deliberately not spelled out here or below: a grep gate reads this file
/// as raw text and cannot tell a prohibition from an implementation.
