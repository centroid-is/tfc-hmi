/// **One page, two sections** (06-CONTEXT, "Roles Screen"). A single
/// `/advanced/access` route with the roles section above the users section.
/// `key_repository.dart` already stacks gated sections on one page and is the
/// analog; two Advanced entries would crowd a menu that is god-gated already.
/// The order is the commissioning order — create roles, then accounts, then
/// close the first-user window — which is the sequence
/// `docs/access-control-deployment.md` §4 now spells out.
///
/// **This file composes and nothing else.** No store, no repository, no Drift,
/// no query, no write. Both sections own their own reads, their own writes and
/// their own four terminal states; the one thing this page owns that neither
/// section does is the *page-level* loading affordance, because a section is
/// one card on a screen and a page is the whole screen.
///
/// **No gate here.** The `users` gate is applied at the route, exactly as it is
/// for the other eight raised routes (`lib/access_routes.dart`,
/// `lib/widgets/access_gate.dart`). A second gate inside the page would be a
/// second place to get it wrong, and it would also hide the honesty note from a
/// `configure`-only engineer — who is precisely the person who might otherwise
/// conclude that the HMI has logins.

/// frame each way, from two independent measurements that agree.
///
/// The note's 64 px is a collapsed Material [ExpansionTile] (56 px) inside a
/// [Card] (4 px of margin each way). **Adding a paragraph to the note does not
/// move this number**, because an [ExpansionTile]'s collapsed height does not
