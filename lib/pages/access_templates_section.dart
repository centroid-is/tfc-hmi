/// The key repository's access-templates section — spec §7d.
///
/// MCP does the plant in a pass (spec §7c); this is where somebody works out
/// what the rules should *be*, and where the one-off change happens. Both
/// front ends edit the same two tables through the same store, and this
/// section is the one that has to make those tables legible.
///
/// ## It is `users`-gated inside a `configure`-gated route
///
/// `/advanced/key-repository` is behind `AccessGate` with `configure`, so
/// everybody who can see this section can already edit key mappings. That does
/// not mean they may re-scope authorization: spec §7c puts templates behind
/// `users` precisely so that somebody who can edit a page cannot grant
/// themselves everything. `AccessTemplateStore` enforces it — every write here
/// goes through it, and there is no other path — and this widget's job is to
/// make the boundary legible **before** the operator presses anything, in the
/// shape this milestone has used everywhere else: visible, tappable,
/// explained, never greyed.
///
/// ## Where each number comes from, and why it matters
///
/// Two different questions look identical and are not:
///
///  * **How many keys does this template govern?** — answered from
///    `TagBindingResolver.keysBoundTo`, the in-memory snapshot 04-05 loads. It
///    is a render-time number, asked once per template per frame, and asking
///    the database for it would put one round trip per template behind every
///    repaint (T-04-41's sibling).
///  * **May this template be deleted?** — answered from
///    `AccessTemplateStore.keysBoundTo`, which reads `access_key_binding`
///    directly. A decision that unrestricts keys must not rest on a snapshot
///    that may be a second stale, and the list the dialog *shows* has to be
///    the list the block *uses*, or the operator is reading one thing while
///    the store decides on another.
///
/// The delete dialog is the only place in this file that asks the database a
/// question of its own.
///
/// ## This file never writes a binding
///
/// Not on delete, not on rename, and there is deliberately no "clean up the
/// dangling keys" button. `AccessTemplateStore.bind` and `unbind` sit behind
/// the same `users` gate, so such a button would be *permitted* — which is
/// exactly why the prohibition is written down rather than assumed. Spec §7d
/// says block rather than silently unbind, and a bulk re-point after a rename
/// is the same silent change with a friendlier label. Binding is per key, on
/// the key's own card, one at a time (04-08) — or in bulk, from an agent's
/// proposal, which is the next paragraph.
///
/// ## It is also where an agent's proposal is approved
///
/// Spec §7c gives templates a second front end: MCP tools that let an agent
/// sweep a plant's bindings in one pass. Those tools write **nothing** —
/// `tfc_mcp_server` has no session and cannot know who is standing at the
/// panel — so they emit proposals, and this section is where a person applies
/// one. It applies them through the same [AccessTemplateStore] as everything
/// else on this card, with `origin: 'mcp'` and with `who` taken from the live
/// session, so:
///
///  * an approver without `users` is refused exactly as they are refused at
///    the create button, and the refusal leaves an `allowed: false` row,
///  * the row names the **approving human**, never the agent. There is no
///    parameter through which the proposal could say otherwise, and the
///    proposal's own `operator_id` is never read,
///  * a `bind` proposal goes through [AccessTemplateStore.bind] like every
///    other binding write. Since the 2026-08-30 ruling there is no second
///    path and no second gate — an earlier draft routed bindings through the
///    `configure`-gated key-mapping blob and would have inherited its weaker
///    gate.
