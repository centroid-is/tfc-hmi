/// The administration page's users section — 06-CONTEXT "Users Screen".
///
/// A roster of accounts with the four columns `AppUser` actually has, four
/// capabilities and no fifth, and the two lockout routes that run through this
/// table refused where the operator can read why. Composed onto a page beside
/// the roles section; this file renders a card and owns no route.
///
/// ## Four columns, and every one of them a real column
///
/// Username, role, created, last login. Those are the four `AppUser` carries
/// (`database_drift.dart`), and the list shows exactly them. A display name is
/// a schema v7 → v8 migration for cosmetics and 06-CONTEXT declines it; so is a
/// `disabled` flag, which is why there is no disable here either — it would be
/// a migration *plus* a change to the login path. What the screen can do is
/// create an account, change its role, reset its password and delete it.
///
/// ## The one rule this file has that the roles section does not
///
/// `access_templates_section.dart`'s `_showProblem` renders the exception in a
/// snackbar, and that is right almost everywhere. It is not right in the two
/// dialogs here that take a typed password. `lib/pages/first_user.dart` refuses
/// to do it on exactly that screen and says why: an `ArgumentError` raised on a
/// bad credential can carry the credential in its message, and a screen where
/// the password is in hand would then put it into a screenshot of a
/// commissioning session. 06-02 made `AccessRepository` throw a bare
/// `ArgumentError` without the value for that reason, and defence in depth here
/// costs one `catch` clause.
///
/// So, explicitly:
///
///  * **The create dialog and the set-password dialog** follow
///    `first_user.dart`: the failure goes to `Logger().e` with a fixed message
///    and the screen shows a fixed sentence of its own. Neither ever renders an
///    exception object.
///  * **Everywhere else in this file** — the role change and the delete, which
///    never hold a credential — uses `_showProblem`, the shared shape the rest
///    of the milestone uses.
///
/// Nothing in this file reads, passes, logs or renders a stored hash or its
/// salt. The password travels from a controller straight to the store and stops
/// there.
///
/// ## Usernames are compared exactly
///
/// `app_user.username` is a case-sensitive TEXT primary key and
/// `AccessRepository.user` documents why: case-folding means picking a locale,
/// and Turkish dotted I turns a login screen into a support call. Nothing in
/// this file folds a username — the duplicate check in the create dialog
/// compares exactly, so a dialog cannot refuse a name the database would have
/// accepted.
///
/// ## A user write is not finished when the row is written
///
/// `ref.invalidate(accessAdminUsersProvider)` refreshes the *roster*. What the
/// running app permits is re-resolved by
/// `AccessSessionController.refreshGroupsFromRoles`, and this section calls it
/// after **every** `setUserRole` and **every** `deleteUser` — never inside an
/// "is this the signed-in account?" conditional. With two `users` holders the
/// invariant permits an admin to move their own account onto a role without
/// `users`, or to delete it outright, and without the call they keep the groups
/// that account gave them until they sign out. That is privilege retention in
/// the phase whose job is administering privileges (T-06-77).
///
/// `createUser` and `setUserPassword` do **not** get the call: a new account
/// holds no session and a password change alters no privilege, so neither can
/// change the caller's own groups.
///
/// **That call goes last, and the ordering is load-bearing.** See [_afterWrite].
///
/// ## The refusal, and the trail
///
/// Trip routes (a) and (b) — deleting the last `users` holder, and moving them
/// onto a role that does not grant it — are refused by `AccessRepository`
/// inside the transaction that would otherwise perform the write. That rule is
/// **not** re-implemented here; this section renders what the transaction threw,
/// through the shared `AccessAdminRefusal`, so its wording and the roles
/// section's cannot drift. There is no override, and none may be added.
///
/// Deleting an account does not touch its audit rows. `audit_entry.who` is a
/// denormalised TEXT column with no foreign key, so the trail outlives the
/// account by construction — and because the obvious assumption is the
/// opposite, the delete confirmation says so out loud.
