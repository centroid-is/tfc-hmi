/// The audit trail: one page, one query, and three ways to have nothing to
/// show.
///
/// The first and only reader's screen. It watches one resolved [AuditQuery] per
/// loaded page, renders 05-05's filter bar above a virtualised list of 05-04's
/// grouped actions, and distinguishes the states that would otherwise all look
/// like a blank screen.
///
/// ## The three terminal states, and why they are three
///
/// Phase 2 ruled that **unavailable** and **empty** must be distinguishable.
/// An empty list drawn over an unreachable database asserts that nothing was
/// ever written on this station — which is the one lie an audit trail cannot
/// tell, and the reason `auditTrailEntriesProvider` answers a nullable
/// [AuditTrailResult] rather than a nullable list.
///
/// **Denied** is the third, and it is deliberately not built here. The route
/// gate renders the locked body before this page is reached, from
/// `kRaisedRoutes['/advanced/audit-trail']`. A second, weaker check on this page
/// could disagree with the first, and the disagreement would be an open page —
/// threat T-05-60. A test in `test/pages/audit_trail_test.dart` reads this
/// file's source with the comments stripped and fails if the permission enum or
/// the locked body is ever named in the code.
///
/// **Loading is none of the three.** Waiting says nothing yet, in exactly the
/// sense `access_gate.dart` already carries for its own three-way. A frame that
/// renders "No entries match these filters" before the query returns is a page
/// that lies for one frame, and a golden that captured such a frame would bake
/// the lie in.
///
/// ## Nothing on this page moves on its own
///
/// No timer, no scroll listener, no stream. The page queries on arrival, on an
/// explicit refresh, on a filter change and on an explicit `Load more`, and at
/// no other time. That is CONTEXT's ruling and it has two reasons: an always-on
/// `Timer.periodic` in this repo's plumbing has broken unrelated widget tests,
/// and an audit list that scrolls or reloads under the finger is unreadable
/// while you are trying to read a row off it. A comment-stripped grep in the
/// test file enforces the absence.
///
/// ## The Page/Body split is mandatory
///
/// `BaseScaffold` calls `context.currentBeamLocation`, so it cannot be pumped
/// without a Beamer ancestor. `FirstUserPage`/`FirstUserBody` and
/// `KeyRepositoryPage`/`KeyRepositoryContent` are the same split for the same
/// reason, and every widget test and every golden of this page pumps the Body.
