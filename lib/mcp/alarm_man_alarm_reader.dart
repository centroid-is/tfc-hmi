/// [AlarmReader] implementation backed by the Flutter app's [AlarmMan].
///
/// Converts [AlarmConfig] objects from [AlarmMan.config.alarms] to
/// `Map<String, dynamic>` format expected by the MCP server's alarm tools.
///
/// Each map contains: uid, key, title, description, rules (serialized
/// via [AlarmRule.toJson]), group and bindToGroup.
///
/// There is deliberately no constructor taking an [AlarmMan]. Holding one --
/// or, worse, holding its `config.alarms` list -- is the bug this class was
/// shipped with: every accepted alarm edit follows its mutation with
/// `invalidate(alarmManProvider)`, which builds a *new* [AlarmMan] around a
/// *new* list read back from preferences. A reader that captured either at
/// construction is pinned to an orphan from that moment on, and answers every
/// MCP alarm read from it until the app is restarted. Confirmed in the field:
/// after 91 alarms were regrouped and persisted, `get_alarm_tree` still
/// reported 6 alarms under "Line 1" where the saved config had 31. Pass a
/// source that resolves the provider instead, so an invalidate is picked up
/// on the next read.
class AlarmManAlarmReader implements AlarmReader {
  /// Creates a reader over a source consulted afresh on every read.
  ///
  /// [source] returns the alarm list of whichever [AlarmMan] is current, or
  /// `null` when there is no current one to read -- the window while
  /// `alarmManProvider` is rebuilding after an invalidate, or after its
  /// container is gone. `null` means "nothing new to say", not "no alarms":
  /// the reader keeps answering from the last list it saw rather than
  /// reporting an empty plant mid-rebuild. An operator who deletes their last
  /// alarm still gets an empty answer, because that is an empty list from a
  /// live [AlarmMan], not a null.
