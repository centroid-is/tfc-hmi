// `FittedBox` -- is the wrong one: `FittedBox` lays the child out at the
// child's own font size and then paints it through a *scale transform*, so the
// glyphs are rasterised for one size and blitted at another. The text goes
// soft, and only sharpens when something forces a re-raster at the size that
// is actually on screen -- which is why zooming the canvas appears to fix it.
//
// The two helpers below do it the other way round: compute a font size for the
// box, then lay the text out AT that size, so the glyphs are rasterised at
// exactly the size they are drawn and there is nothing left to resample.

/// text out at rather than a factor to scale it by.

/// labels that should not swell to fill their whole box. The default of 1.0
/// caps nothing, which reproduces `BoxFit.contain`.
