// Third-party equipment painters — one CustomPainter per equipment kind.
//
// Each paints a SIMPLIFIED PLAN VIEW (looking straight down) of a machine we
// do not control, drawn from the manufacturer's own photos and spec sheets so
// an operator recognises which box on the line they are looking at. They are
// hand-authored in normalised unit coordinates rather than exported from CAD
// (contrast `widgets/baader.dart`, a real DXF export) — we have no drawings
// for third-party gear.
//
// Sources for the geometry, per kind:
//   Multivac      R 245 spec sheet + machine photo — 5437 x 1002 mm,
//                 320 mm nominal web width, 280 mm max forming width,
//                 ~330 mm cross-cut zone, 800 mm discharge belt.
//   SpeedBatcher  Jón's sketch of the station as actually built on this line
//                 (buffers, infeed flat + step-up conveyors, two
//                 checkweighers) — NOT the Marel brochure, whose batcher head
//                 is a guarded cube with nothing visible from above.
//   Box erector   generic RSC erector (Eastey ERX-15 class) — 2395 x 2083 mm,
//                 side-loading blank magazine, 8-cup vacuum pick, flap
//                 folders, bottom centre-seal tape head, side-belt discharge.
//   Strapping     Afak SL-15-3 with StrapX heads — 2665 x 1815 mm, three
//                 arches in series over one belt, three coil dispensers on a
//                 rear gantry, ~530 mm boxes at 15/min.
//   Palletiser    Optimar drawing 10-N1230-1, "Foundation Requirements for
//                 Robots Ph-1 / Robotic Palletizing Stations for white boxes"
//                 (abuana, 28/04/2026, 1:50 on A2). A FOUNDATION drawing, so
//                 the floor plan is exact and nothing above knee height is on
//                 it: stations on a 3500 mm pitch (robot centres 5210 / 8710 /
//                 12210), ~3.9 m pallet lane each, Ø1800 pad carrying a Ø1250
//                 base plate on a Ø1110 bolt circle, 8 x M20 chemical anchors,
//                 2250 kg per robot, double-door cabinets, a transfer rail
//                 along the front and a pallet magazine off it.
//
// Painters are PURE — primitives in, pixels out. ZERO subscriptions, ZERO
// Riverpod, ZERO state. Same contract as `sensor_painter.dart`.
//
// Every painter draws the SAME dotted boundary box (the "not our scope of
// supply" marker, and the tap-target hint) and then its own machine glyph
// inside [thirdPartyMachineArea]. The run-status LED is NOT painted here — it
// is a real `LEDPainter` composited over the top-left header strip by the
// widget in `third_party.dart`, so it looks identical to every other LED on
// the page.
//
// Detail is drawn at the configured stroke width, NOT scaled with the asset,
// so a small asset degrades into a legible silhouette rather than a grey
// smudge. These layouts reward being placed at their true aspect ratio — see
// `ThirdPartyEquipmentKind.aspectRatio` in `third_party.dart`.
