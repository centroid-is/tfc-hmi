/// Beckhoff EtherCAT Box — the IP67 modules bolted to the machines instead of
/// racked in a cabinet. Two types are fitted on this plant, and they share an
/// asset because they share a housing.
///
///  * **EP2338-1002** — 8-channel digital combi, every socket usable either
///    way. ST301 alone carries eight of them, and the PLC comments name what
///    each one is: `ST301_RM04` the strapping machine, `ST301_RM05` the box
///    erector, `ST301_RM08` the control buttons on the column. Each is an
///    `ST_EP2338_0002` — `I0..I7` on `%I*`, `O0..O7` on `%Q*` — so its
///    sockets are lit from live data.
///
///  * **EP1918-0002** — TwinSAFE, safe digital inputs, yellow housing.
///    `ST301.EM01`, `ST301.EM02` and one on device 5. It publishes nothing:
///    the safe inputs are consumed by TwinSAFE logic inside the network and
///    no station's EtherCAT GVL so much as names one. Its sockets stay dark,
///    and its pane says why rather than showing eight lamps that mean
///    nothing.
///
/// This library holds the variants, the decode and the operator surface. The
/// subscription lives with the asset in `beckhoff.dart`.
