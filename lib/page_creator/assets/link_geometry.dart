/// Geometry for assets that are a *run* rather than a box.
///
/// Every other asset on a page is a point and a size: `AssetStack` gives it a
/// rectangle and it paints inside. A cable is not that shape. It has two ends
/// that belong to other assets, however many corners the hall put in between,
/// and no meaningful width — so its position is not something an operator
/// types, it is something they draw.
///
/// The model here is the one the four editing benches converged on:
///
///  - **Ends are ports, not points.** A [LinkEnd] names the asset and the port
///    it plugs into. Move the terminal and the cable stays plugged in. An end
///    with no `assetId` falls back to a free page coordinate, which is what a
///    run to somewhere off-page (or to an asset since deleted) degrades to.
///
///  - **Corners are placed, never described.** A [LinkWaypoint] carries no
///    sweep and no per-corner radius. The conveyor's turn panel asks for three
///    numbers per bend, none of which are the thing you are looking at, and
///    all of which move each other; the whole point of this model is that the
///    equivalent numbers are *derived* from where the corner was dropped.
///
///  - **A corner follows something.** By default it follows the run: stored as
///    a fraction [LinkWaypoint.t] along the port-to-port axis and an offset
///    [LinkWaypoint.n] across it, so moving either device rotates and scales
///    the shape as a whole. Pinned to an asset instead, it is a fixed offset
///    from that asset's box and ignores the far end completely — which is the
///    truthful model for a run that leaves a cabinet at a fixed point on a
///    tray and only then heads for the device.
///
/// Everything stored is normalised to the 0..1 page space the rest of the
/// page_creator uses, so a page still scales to any screen. [LinkRun.resolve]
/// is the one place that converts to canvas pixels.
