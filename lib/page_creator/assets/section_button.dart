// `FB_Section` (SVNCoreComponents/Section/FB_Section.TcPOU) is the generic
// line controller behind every section of the plant — `section.beforeFreezers`,
// `section.afterFreezers`, `section.boxPackingFilm`, … Its `HMI` member is a
// structured OPC UA node (`ST_Section_HMI`) with everything this asset needs
// and nothing it does not:
//
//   p_cmd_Start        momentary — TOGGLES q_xEnabled, clears cleaning
//   p_cmd_StartClean   momentary — TOGGLES q_xCleanEnabled, clears auto
//   p_cmd_Stop         momentary — drops both
//   p_stat_xEnabled    the section is running in auto
//   p_stat_xCleanEnabled  the section is running in cleaning
//   p_stat_xPermissive external interlock; FALSE drops the outputs and
//                      makes both start commands no-ops
//
// The FB clears the command bits itself on the scan it processes them, so the
// HMI writes TRUE and never has to write FALSE back.
//
// The toggle semantics of the two start commands are the trap in this
// interface, and the reason [canStart] / [canClean] exist: sending
// `p_cmd_Start` to a section that is already running STOPS it. Nothing here
// ever offers a command that would do the opposite of what its label says —
// and with several sections behind one button that guard has to be applied
// per section, not to the group, or one press would start the stopped members
// and stop the running ones, leaving the line exactly as it was, inverted.

// Two sections on this plant are not peers, they are alternatives. ST201 and

//
//   section.boxPackingFilm  (i_xPermissive := NOT section.boxPackingVacuum.q_xEnabled);
//   section.boxPackingVacuum(i_xPermissive := NOT section.boxPackingFilm.q_xEnabled);
//
// so exactly one of them can be in auto at a time, by construction. A button
// driving both was therefore PERMANENTLY split, and a split that is always
// there stops meaning "something is wrong" — it means "everything is normal",
// which destroys the signal for every other button too.
//
// The HMI cannot infer this. The exclusion lives in ladder it never sees, and
// `p_stat_xPermissive` reports only the result — an idle section with no
// go-ahead looks identical whether its twin has the line or an upstream
// interlock has failed. So it is declared in config, on the section itself:
// [SectionRef.exclusiveGroup].
//
// Two facts about that ladder shape the code below, and both come from
// `FB_Section` itself rather than from a guess:
//
//   * The permissive keys off `q_xEnabled` ONLY, so cleaning is NOT exclusive.
//     Both modes may clean at once, and a section held off while its twin is
//     merely cleaning is NOT explained by the exclusion.
//   * Two members in auto at once is impossible while the interlock holds, so
//     seeing it means the interlock is not doing its job. The pane says so;
//     the face cannot, because two sections in the same mode is agreement and
//     there is no seam to draw.
