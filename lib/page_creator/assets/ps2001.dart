/// Beckhoff PS2001-2410 — the 24 V DC / 10 A supply behind each station's
/// 24 V rail.
///
/// The PLC publishes one `ST_PS2001_2410` per unit
/// (`SVNCoreComponents/ECT/ST_PS2001_2410.TcDUT`), linked straight off the
/// unit's `PSU Inputs` PDO. Six members, all read-only — the supply takes no
/// commands, so unlike the EL9222 there is nothing for the HMI to write and
/// the pane is a reading, not a control.
///
/// Two of the six are analogue, and they are the reason this asset exists at
/// all. Everything else on a mimic answers "is it on?"; the output volts and
/// amps answer "how close is it to falling over?", which is the question
/// somebody actually walks to the cabinet with.
///
/// This library holds the decode and the operator surface. The subscription
/// lives with the asset in `beckhoff.dart` — a pane is built into the root
/// overlay and a widget that reads providers from there is not on the page's
/// tree.
