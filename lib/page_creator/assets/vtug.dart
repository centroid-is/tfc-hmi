/// On this plant the terminal is a **VTUG-14** manifold with a **CTEU-EC**
/// bus node bolted to its left end plate. The EtherCAT config in the PLC
/// repo calls the electronics `VAEM-L1-S-8-PT [16DO]`: eight valve
/// positions, two solenoid coils apiece, sixteen digital outputs. Three of
/// these are fitted — `ST303.A1` on Device 2, plus two more on Device 5.

/// ST303_A1_C2_Output AT %Q* : BYTE;   // positions 5..8

/// Those are the PLC's own outputs — it writes them every scan, so the HMI

/// the PLC reads and the HMI owns; see [VtugTerminal] for the struct this
