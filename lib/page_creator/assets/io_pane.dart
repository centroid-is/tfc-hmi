/// The pane answers two questions, and it answers both without opening
/// anything: *is this module healthy*, and *what is each channel wired to*.
///
/// It used to answer only the first, and put the per-channel answer behind a
/// "Channel detail" tile that opened a ~900px `RowIOView` grid in a floating
/// dialog. That width was force buttons and filter fields, not information —
/// and on this plant the PLC accepts no override, so the buttons were a
/// control surface for a capability that does not exist. With them gone the
/// only thing the dialog still carried was the channel descriptions, which
/// fit in the pane perfectly well and belong there: a description you have
/// to open a window to read is a description nobody reads.
///
/// [gridBuilder] is what remains of that dialog, and it is now optional. A
/// module whose PLC does take a force still passes one and keeps its tile;
/// the Beckhoff terminals pass nothing and have no dialog at all.
