/// The target is matched semantically at apply time -- by `asset_type`,
/// narrowed by `title` (the asset's display text) and/or `key` (its bound
/// tag key) when given -- so a proposal stays valid when the page is
/// reordered between proposing and applying. The match must be unique:
/// zero or several candidates both fail, leaving the page untouched, so a
/// stale proposal can never silently patch the wrong asset.
///
/// An `index` (position in the page's flat assets array, as returned by
/// get_asset_detail) picks between candidates the semantic match cannot
/// tell apart. It is a tie-breaker, never trusted alone: the asset at
/// that position must still satisfy the semantic selector, so an index
/// gone stale through insert/delete/reorder fails loudly instead of
/// patching whatever slid into the slot.
///
/// The patch is a shallow merge onto the asset's JSON (its `asset_name`
/// cannot be changed). With `child_id` set, the patch instead targets the
/// child entry with that stable id inside the asset -- merging into the
/// entry's embedded `child` asset when it has one (ThirdPartyEquipment,
/// Elevator), or the entry itself otherwise.
///
/// The caller is responsible for storing [AssetUpdateResult.updated] back
/// at [AssetUpdateResult.index]; this function does not mutate [assets].
