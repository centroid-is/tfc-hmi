// A D3D11 device the runner keeps purely so it can be asked why it died.
//
// The reason the log has nothing useful in it after a device loss is that the
// only device that knows is ANGLE's, and ANGLE's lives inside
// flutter_windows.dll where we cannot reach it. So the runner creates a device
// of its own on the same (default) adapter at startup and never renders with
// it. It costs a few hundred kilobytes and answers the one question that
// matters: GetDeviceRemovedReason().
//
// The event that takes ANGLE's device down -- a TDR, a driver restart, an
// adapter reset -- is adapter-wide, so this device goes down with it and its
// reason code is ANGLE's reason code. When this device is *still alive* after
// the renderer has stopped presenting frames, that is a finding in itself: the
// GPU is fine and something narrower killed the render context, which points
// at the session/desktop swap rather than at the driver.
//
// Deliberately not unit tested: every line is a D3D call, there is no seam
// worth inventing, and the decisions this feeds are all in gpu_diagnosis.h
// where they are tested. Everything here fails soft -- a machine where the
// device cannot be created still runs the app, it just reports "no sentinel"
// instead of a reason.
