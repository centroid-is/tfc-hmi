// GPU device-loss watchdog.
//
// The problem, as it appears in the logs:
//
//   [ERROR:...egl/egl.cc(57)] EGL Error: Context Lost (12302) in .../context.cc
//   [ERROR:...gpu_surface_gl_skia.cc(220)] Could not make the context current
//                                          to acquire the frame.
//
// repeating forever, with the process alive but the window frozen on its last
// frame. It means the D3D11 device ANGLE renders through was destroyed under
// it. In a VM that happens when the host sleeps and the virtual GPU resets,
// when an RDP session connects or disconnects and Windows swaps the session's
// display adapter, or when the graphics driver resets (TDR).
//
// Recovering requires rebuilding the EGL display, context and surface plus
// Skia's GrDirectContext. The Flutter Windows embedder does not do that -- it
// retries eglMakeCurrent every frame and fails every frame. Those sources ship
// as a prebuilt flutter_windows.dll, so we cannot fix it there without forking
// the engine. What the runner *can* do is destroy and recreate
// FlutterViewController: that runs egl::Manager's destructor (eglTerminate,
// releasing the dead device) and then its constructor (eglInitialize, creating
// a fresh one). The Dart VM restarts with it, so the app reboots -- which for a
// 24/7 HMI beats a permanently frozen screen.
//
// --- Why this was rewritten (2026-08-31) -----------------------------------
//
// The first version inferred death from the ABSENCE of frames: probe by asking
// the engine for one (ForceRedraw + the next-frame callback), and after two
// unanswered probes call it dead. On 2026-08-31 a station froze at 19:47 and
// was still frozen, still logging, thirty-six minutes later, with the default
// exit-on-loss policy in force. The watchdog never declared anything.
//
// Two properties of that inference turned out to be wrong:
//
//  1. ABSENCE IS NOT OBSERVABLE FROM A STARVED TIMER. The tick was a WM_TIMER
//     on the host window. WM_TIMER is the lowest-priority message there is:
//     GetMessage synthesises it only when no other message is waiting. A lost
//     context makes every frame fail in microseconds and immediately reschedule,
//     so the platform thread's posted-message queue never empties and the tick
//     is never generated. The failure that the watchdog exists to catch is
//     precisely the failure that silences it. (SendMessage jumps that queue,
//     which is why the frozen process still answered WM_NULL in 10 ms and
//     looked "responding" throughout -- and why the host now drives this class
//     from a timer-queue thread and marshals with SendMessageTimeout.)
//
//  2. ABSENCE IS THE SYMPTOM, NOT THE CONDITION. The engine knows the context
//     is lost -- it says so, twice a frame. Waiting to notice that frames
//     stopped is a slower and strictly weaker test than asking the device. So
//     OnRendererLost() now exists: a POSITIVE report that the context is gone,
//     which declares the loss immediately instead of waiting out a famine.
//     The probe survives as the backstop for losses no device query catches.
//
// This class owns only the decision: is the renderer dead, and what should the
// host do about it. It is deliberately free of Win32 and Flutter types so the
// decision can be unit tested without a GPU -- see test/gpu_watchdog_test.cpp.
// FlutterWindow is the adapter that feeds it events and executes its actions.
//
// Every entry point takes the host's monotonic clock in milliseconds. The
// watchdog never reads a clock itself: the repeat-loss guard needs one, and a
// class that cannot be run at a thousand times speed in a test is a class
// whose escalation rules never get tested.
