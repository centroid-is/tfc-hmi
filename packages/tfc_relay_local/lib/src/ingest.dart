/// One poisoned tag costs one tag.
///
/// The standing constraint since Phase 1, reaching here the first code able to
/// break it: **sanitize failure = ONE TAG fails, never a poll cycle.**
///
/// `sanitize` throws `ArgumentError` on depth > 64 or on a self-referential
/// structure (`packages/tfc_relay_protocol/lib/src/sanitize.dart:33-39`), and
/// `DynamicValue`'s constructor enforces the same bound on the way in
/// (`dynamic_value.dart:609-619`) — deliberately, because that constructor runs
/// *on the gateway* over structures the **upstream** controls. A struct-heavy
/// TwinCAT tag is exactly where a depth-64 structure appears, and the honest
/// framing is that the bound will be hit by ordinary configuration and not by
/// an attacker.
///
/// So the `try`/`catch` is **per key**, and the arithmetic is the whole point:
/// a poll cycle at this plant is 430 tags. Wrapping the batch costs 429 good
/// readings to one bad one, and costs them silently — every affected page reads
/// unknown, and nothing anywhere says which tag did it. Wrapping the key costs
/// one tag and names it.
///
/// ## What is caught
///
/// Every `Object`, not just `ArgumentError`. Narrowing the catch to the one
/// exception `sanitize` documents would make the guarantee depend on the
/// converters — which 08-07 and 08-10 have not written yet — never throwing
/// anything else, and that is a promise about code that does not exist. The
/// boundary's job is that one tag's conversion cannot cost the cycle, whatever
/// went wrong inside it; the error object is kept, so a diagnosis is not lost
/// in exchange.
///
/// ## Worst-wins is not re-implemented here
///
/// There is deliberately no hand-rolled quality comparison in this file.
/// `DynamicValue`'s constructor composes worst-wins over the supplied quality
/// and every child's, and mints `Quality.badNonFinite` through `Quality.worst`
/// for a non-finite leaf (`dynamic_value.dart:643-648`). Calling it *is* the
/// composition. A second implementation here would be a second thing to keep
/// right, and the two would disagree on the day somebody added a code.
