/// The clock that notices silence — and only runs while somebody is watching.
///
/// ## Why a clock at all
///
/// Staleness is a function of time, not of events. The failure this exists to
/// make visible **emits nothing**: a frozen OPC UA session, a PLC that stopped
/// scanning, a weigher that answered its last frame an hour ago. Every one of
/// those looks, to an event-driven pipeline, exactly like a tag that has not
/// changed — and a plausible number under a good quality is the single failure
/// PROJECT.md names as the reason the whole project exists. The shipped stack
/// has `staleAfter` declared and **nothing sweeping for it**, which is that
/// failure waiting to happen on the gateway side.
///
/// ## Why it is listener-gated, and what that costs
///
/// `ClientWrapper`'s effective-status timer is the in-repo pattern and this
/// copies its **three properties**, not just its shape
/// (`packages/tfc_dart/lib/core/state_man.dart:966-992`):
///
///  1. **The clock only runs while someone is watching** (`:970-975`). An
///     always-on `Timer.periodic` leaks past every test that builds a source
///     without draining it ("A Timer is still pending…"), and an unobserved
///     gateway has nobody to tell anyway. The gate here is the fan-in's watcher
///     count: [start] on the transition from zero, [stop] on the return to it.
///  2. **The verdict is re-derived on read, so nothing goes stale while the
///     timer is parked** (`:1000`, `:1005-1031`). [judge] is that
///     re-derivation, and it is what makes the gate *safe* rather than merely
///     cheap — a read taken after an unwatched hour is still correct.
///  3. **A recompute bails when nothing would change** (`:1033-1038`). Here
///     that is the band comparison in [sweep]: a key already carrying worse
///     news than `badStale` stages nothing, so the four-times-per-deadline
///     cadence costs a listening page zero rebuilds until something actually
///     moves.
///
/// The reference implementation's watchdog is always-on
/// (`fake_state_man.dart:71`) — **that is a fake's licence and not a
/// gateway's**. A fake exists for the length of one test; this object exists
/// for the length of a plant shift.
///
/// ## The fourth property: the age is asked of an elapsed clock
///
/// `ClientWrapper`'s three properties are above; this one is 07-REVIEW CR-01's,
/// and it is the reason this file takes an `int Function()` rather than a
/// `DateTime Function()`. *How long since this value arrived* is an
/// elapsed-time question, and `DateTime.now()` steps: NTP corrects it, an
/// operator sets it, a suspended VM resumes with a different one. A backwards
/// correction larger than [staleAfter] made the old subtraction negative for
/// **every key in the store at once**, so this swept nothing and the read
/// path's [judge] agreed with it — the whole plant reading fresh from PLCs
/// nobody had heard from. A forward step did the mirror image and greyed
/// everything.
///
/// The client was fixed for this in `6a499d65`; 08-REVIEW CR-02 found the same
/// arithmetic gateway-side, where it costs every panel rather than one. There
/// is deliberately **no wall-clock seam left to hand in** (07-REVIEW's note on
/// `c4e62845`): a seam that accepts a steppable clock is a seam somebody steps.
///
/// ## Why health keys are skipped by prefix
///
/// 06-09 found the trap on `days_to_expiry`: a value that changes once a day is
/// *always* older than any freshness deadline, so freshness accounting greys
/// out the indicator permanently and precisely while nothing is wrong. **The
/// trap is not specific to that key.** `PIPE.upstream.<alias>.connected`,
/// `.birth_count`, `.last_death_at`, `.state`, `.epoch` and `PIPE.connected`
/// itself all change only on an event, and every one of them would grey out the
/// same way (08-RESEARCH §D.3).
///
/// So the skip is [PipeKeys.isPipeKey] — a **prefix test**, never an enumerated
/// list. An enumerated list is a list a new key gets added outside of, and the
/// symptom of forgetting is an indicator that reads stale exactly when an
/// operator is deciding whether to believe the rest of the screen.
