/// ```
///
/// `read` uses the same order with M2400 first (`:1802-1879`). **Three
/// departures**, all deliberate, all written here so the next reader finds the
/// decision instead of re-litigating it:
///
///  1. **`PIPE.` takes `@conn`'s slot.** `@conn` short-circuits at `:1805` on
///     read, `:2057` on subscribe and `:1994` on write — before the disabled
///     check, before any client is consulted, never through keymappings.
///     [PipeKeyRoute] lands in exactly that position. `@conn/<alias>/<field>`
///     itself is *not* served here: it is a shipped reserved prefix in the
///     app-side `StateMan` with an almost identical field catalogue
///     (`conn_meta.dart:37-63` — `reconnectCount` is `birth_count` under
///     another name, `uptimeSec` is `last_death_at` inverted), and 08-CONTEXT
///     **ruling 4** says the gateway serves `PIPE.*` only, gateway-native,
///     with an alias layer available as a reversible later addition if page
///     churn proves painful. Two reserved namespaces for pipeline health is
///     one too many; that is the recorded decision, not an oversight.
///  2. **Substitution is gone.** `resolveKey` (`:1709-1733`) is deliberately
///     **not** ported: `state_man_api.dart:26-31` froze `setSubstitution` /
///     `substitutions` / `substitutionsChanged` / `resolveKey` as a
///     *client-local key rewrite* — the client resolves the key and subscribes
///     to the resolved one. So a key still carrying a `$` is
///     [RouteRefusal.substitutionUnsupported], the value-shaped equivalent of
///     `_throwIfUnresolved` (`:1704-1707`) and for its stated reason: a key
///     with an unresolved variable addresses a node that cannot exist, and
///     "cannot exist" must not arrive looking like a dead tag.
///  3. **The write path still routes M2400.** The shipped `write`
///     (`:1992-2045`) skips the M2400 entirely because the device is read-only.
///     Here the router routes it like anything else and the *link* answers
///     [WriteRejected] — `state_man_api.dart:114-117` names
///     `M2400DeviceClientAdapter.write`'s `UnsupportedError` as what not to
///     copy, because a throw on the write path reads to the operator as "the
///     write failed", which is the one thing a refusal to try does not prove
///     about the plant.
///
/// ## What this file does not redeclare
///
/// The keymapping model is `tfc_dart`'s. `KeyMappings`, `KeyMappingEntry`,
/// `OpcUANodeConfig`, `M2400NodeConfig` and `ModbusNodeConfig` are what the
/// live plant file deserializes into and what the page editor writes; a
/// parallel model here would be a second migration path for every future
/// field. What this file adds is the *router* and the *ingest result*.
