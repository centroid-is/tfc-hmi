/// The per-link health producer: every PLC's condition as an ordinary tag.
///
/// ## There is no health method
///
/// The absence is a recorded decision, not an omission (design §4.7, HLTH-01).
/// These names are subscribable exactly like a temperature — same store, same
/// quality codes, same widgets — which is what makes a health indicator
/// something an integrator can drop on a page rather than something the client
/// has to grow an API for. Every name is built by [PipeKeys]; nothing here
/// spells one.
///
/// ## Seeded at construction
///
/// Every key exists before anything can subscribe, for
/// `fake_state_man.dart:616-622`'s reason, quoted because it is the whole
/// argument: *"a health indicator that reads unknown until the first fault
/// tells an operator nothing at the moment they most need telling."* A page
/// bound to a key the store has never heard of shows a blank, and a blank is
/// also what a mistyped binding looks like.
///
/// ## Never a plausible zero, and never a plausible false
///
/// `cert_health_state_man.dart:115-126` is the rule and it generalises: a
/// reading this producer cannot make is a **null** value under
/// [Quality.errorConfig]. Never `0`, never `false`, never the epoch instant.
///
///  * `connected: false` on a link nobody has asked about yet sends an
///    engineer to a PLC that is fine. "Not known yet" and "known to be down"
///    are different things on a wall.
///  * `birth_count: 0` on an unasked link reads as a PLC that has never come up
///    since the gateway started, which is a specific and alarming claim.
///  * `last_death_at: 0` renders as 1 January 1970.
///
/// The inverse holds too, and it is why `last_error` and `last_death_at` are
/// **null under good quality** once the link has been asked: the gateway
/// looked, and the answer is "nothing". That is knowledge, and an empty string
/// would be a value a page could render into a blank box.
///
/// ## Event-driven, with one gauge re-derived on read
///
/// This producer starts no clock. Six of the seven keys change only on a link
/// event, which is exactly why they are exempt from the freshness sweep
/// (HLTH-02) — a value that changes once a shift is always older than any
/// freshness deadline. The seventh, `data_age_ms`, is a gauge: it advances with
/// elapsed time whether or not anything happens — on a monotonic anchor and
/// never on the RTC (08-REVIEW CR-02; see [PipeHealth._elapsedMs]).
///
/// A gauge written only on events would freeze at the last event's reading,
/// which is the stale-but-plausible number this project exists to prevent
/// wearing a health key's clothes. It is handled the way 08-05 handles
/// freshness and for the same stated reason (`state_man.dart:1000`,
/// `:1005-1031`): the stored value is written on events, and [judge]
/// **re-derives it synchronously on read** without writing. So a diagnostics
/// poll is always correct, a read is still not an event, and no timer was
/// added to a package whose timer count is a pinned number.
///
/// What that leaves is a *pushed* `data_age_ms` that advances only when
/// something happens on its link. The slow-cadence refresh belongs with the
/// per-session gauges of 08-12 — `effective_hz`, `egress_kbps`,
/// `event_loop_lag_ms` all need one tick between them — and is recorded here
/// rather than built, because a second repeating clock in this package is a
/// decision somebody should make on purpose.
///
/// ## The app's shipped equivalent
///
/// `@conn/<alias>/<field>` (`conn_meta.dart:30-64`) answers almost exactly this
/// question already: its `reconnectCount` is `birth_count` under another name
/// and its `uptimeSec` is `last_death_at` inverted. That overlap is a good sign
/// — the Sparkplug `bdSeq` adoption is landing on something the plant already
/// wanted. 08-CONTEXT ruling 4: the gateway serves the reserved namespace only,
/// and an alias layer over it is a reversible later addition if page churn
/// proves painful. Recorded, not built.
