/// The eleven `HistoryViewApi` methods over `tfc_dart`'s history tables — the
/// mapping layer between drift's untyped row bags and the wire's records.
///
/// ## This file does not import the database layer, and that is deliberate
///
/// `freeze_test.dart` pins the number of files under this package's `lib/`
/// that import `tfc_dart/core/database*.dart` at **two** — the write adapter
/// (`collect/timescale_sink.dart`) and the read adapter
/// (`data/timescale_reader.dart`) — because `Database`'s constructor starts a
/// flush timer and its connect ladder retries forever, and every additional
/// import site is another place those leak onto the gateway's value path and
/// another place a second connection pool gets built without anyone deciding
/// to (T-10-28).
///
/// A third history-shaped adapter would have been a third site. It is not one:
/// this file takes [DatabaseSupplier] — declared next door in
/// `timescale_reader.dart` — and reaches the drift methods through the value
/// it returns. Dart resolves members on a static type without the type's
/// library being imported, so the seam holds at two and this file still calls
/// `createHistoryView` directly. Nothing is re-declared, nothing is copied,
/// and there is exactly one `Database` in the process.
///
/// The supplier is a supplier for the same two reasons the reader's is: the
/// sink connects in the background and swaps its instance on reconnect, so a
/// pinned instance is stale after the first one, and `null` means the
/// historian is not up — [HistorianUnavailable], retryable, never a hang and
/// never an empty answer. An empty answer here is worse than a refusal: a view
/// picker that says "you have saved nothing" is a picker an operator saves
/// their view into a second time.
///
/// ## The four ways the wire shape and the database shape disagree
///
/// Each of these is a wrong answer that looks like a right one, which is why
/// each has its own paragraph at the site rather than a line in a changelog.
///
/// 1. **drift hands back untyped `Map<String, dynamic>` bags** for keys and
///    graphs (`database_drift.dart:685`, `:704`). Mapped field by field here;
///    no `dynamic` leaves this file.
/// 2. **`createHistoryView` reads its graph map's keys with `int.tryParse` and
///    silently skips whatever fails** (`:610`, and again at `:655` on the
///    update path). The wire type is `Map<int, …>`, so the drop is unreachable
///    from a client — see [graphConfigRows], which is where that claim is made
///    good rather than assumed.
/// 3. **A graph's `name` is nullable in the database and non-nullable on the
///    wire.** [graphConfigRows] and [graphRecordFrom] carry the decision and
///    its consequence.
/// 4. **`getGlobalRetentionHorizon` builds a LOCAL instant and swallows every
///    failure as `null`** (`:774`, `:775-778`). See
///    [HistoryViewStore.getGlobalRetentionHorizon].
///
/// ## PHASE 10 READS AND NEVER WRITES — and what that does not mean
///
/// The sweep over this directory forbids `insertTimeseriesData` and
/// `registerRetentionPolicy`: no sample is recorded here and no retention
/// policy is installed, uninstalled or reinstalled from the read path, which
/// is the two-writer fight 8b settled while the application's own collector
/// still runs. Saving a *view* is not historising: it writes four small
/// configuration tables the application's HMI has always written, and
/// `HistoryViewApi` is four-fifths mutators.
