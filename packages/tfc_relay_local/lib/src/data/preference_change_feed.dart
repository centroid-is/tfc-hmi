/// The all-keys preference change signal: this gateway's writes, and
/// everybody else's.
///
/// ## Why not `PreferencesWatcher`
///
/// `tfc_dart` already has a class for exactly the gap this closes — a headless
/// process never hearing an edit an HMI station made — and it is **not
/// instantiated here**. Its constructor takes a `Set<String> keys` and freezes
/// it (`preferences_watch.dart:34-43`), which is the wrong shape for DB-03: a
/// key created after the watcher was built is invisible to it forever, and
/// DB-03 wants *any* preference's change to reach a second client. Research
/// §E.2 recommended listening to the channel underneath it directly, which is
/// what this does, and the citation is here so nobody re-adds the watcher for
/// symmetry.
///
/// The digest machinery goes with it. `PreferencesWatcher` answers every
/// signal with a server-side `md5(value)` query so a re-save of an identical
/// config is a no-op. That is worth its query when the watched set is fixed
/// and small; over *all* keys it is a query per notification against a table
/// whose largest row is half a megabyte, to suppress an event whose only cost
/// downstream is one coalesced frame. The trade is recorded rather than
/// inherited: **this feed announces a write, not a difference**, so a client
/// that saves the value it already had makes every panel re-read once.
///
/// ## The two halves, and why the merge needs de-duplication
///
///  * **Local** — `Preferences`' own broadcast controller
///    (`preferences.dart:154-155`), which fires for writes made through this
///    process. The gateway is the single writer for every connected client, so
///    this half alone satisfies contract check 13.
///  * **The channel** — `flutter_preferences`' keyed LISTEN/NOTIFY trigger,
///    which fires for writes made by *anybody*, including this gateway.
///
/// So a gateway-originated write arrives twice: once locally, and a few
/// milliseconds later as its own NOTIFY. [window] is what collapses that pair.
///
/// ### The window's arithmetic
///
/// 250 ms, and the number is a bound on **one event's round trip**, not a
/// guess about how busy the machine is. `pg_notify` delivers at commit; the
/// notification connection is a dedicated idle socket
/// (`database_drift.dart:470`, 8b-02's `…:notify` convention), so the delay
/// between the local stream firing and the NOTIFY landing is one TCP hop plus
/// the driver's read loop — single-digit milliseconds on a LAN and on the
/// loopback the gateway actually uses. 250 ms is roughly fifty times that.
///
/// What the margin costs, stated plainly: **two genuinely distinct edits to
/// the same key less than 250 ms apart are announced once.** That is safe for
/// every client this pipe has, because they all react by re-reading and the
/// re-read returns the later value; it would be wrong only for a client
/// counting edits, and nothing counts edits. The case that keeps this honest
/// is the one asserting a second change *outside* the window is **not**
/// suppressed — a window that had quietly become minutes would still pass the
/// first half.
///
/// De-duplication suppresses the *event* and never the [invalidate]: a
/// suppressed NOTIFY still drops the store's cache, so the read a client makes
/// after the one event it did get is fresh. Getting that backwards would trade
/// a duplicate frame for a stale answer.
///
/// ## The gap, made visible
///
/// The channel is listener-gated: it opens on the first subscriber and closes
/// with the last, because a gateway with no sessions has nobody to tell and no
/// reason to hold a connection open. That means there are two ways to be deaf
/// — nobody listening, and the notification connection dying — and both leave
/// a window in which somebody else's edit produces no event at all.
///
/// So every successful (re-)listen is followed by [resync], which re-reads the
/// table and announces every key that differs from the cache. A missed NOTIFY
/// therefore costs latency, not the event. A re-listen is also logged, because
/// a plant where preference edits sometimes arrive late should not be
/// indistinguishable from one where they always arrive at once.
///
/// ## An observation, and deliberately no change
///
/// `_preferenceChanged` on the client calls
/// `watchdog.sawFrame(InboundFrame.update)`
/// (`connection_supervisor.dart:764`), so a preference notification counts as
/// evidence the link is alive. That is consistent with "freshness resets on
/// any inbound frame", and it means a chatty preference store could mask a
/// dead *value* path. Nothing here changes because of it; the observation is
/// the deliverable.
///
/// ## The payload is the key and never the value
///
/// `enableKeyedNotificationChannel` ships `{"action":…,"key":…}` — a few dozen
/// bytes whatever the row holds (`database_drift.dart:1190-1238`). It has to:
/// `pg_notify` caps payloads at 8000 bytes and enforces the cap **by erroring
/// the statement that fired the trigger**, so a row-payload trigger on a table
/// holding a 530 KiB `key_mappings` would make every save of that row fail
/// outright. This file therefore reads the key out of the payload and goes
/// back to the table for anything else.
