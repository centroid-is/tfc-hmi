/// The OPC UA [UpstreamLink]: real quality, real source time, one supervised
/// iterate loop.
///
/// **Wrap, do not rebuild.** This class owns a `ClientWrapper`
/// (`packages/tfc_dart/lib/core/state_man.dart:834`) and not a session manager
/// of its own, because that class encodes three dated, measured things:
///
///  * the **two-phase resubscribe** that fixed a monitored-item storm
///    (`:1458-1510`, and the ordering at `:1480-1501`),
///  * a **heartbeat-derived effective status** with a 15 s stale / 30 s grace
///    window (`:958-964`) — the only thing that catches the frozen-session
///    failure, where TCP is Established, the channel is formally open, and no
///    state event is ever emitted again,
///  * `isSubscriptionDead` (`:872`), which tells a transient `Inactivity` from
///    a fatal `SubscriptionDeleted` / `SecureChannelClosed`.
///
/// Rebuilding those to the same fidelity is not a phase, and the failure mode
/// is silent. What is *not* inherited is the composer above them: `StateMan`'s
/// throwing `read`/`write` (`:1876-1878`, `:2042-2044`), its
/// `Future<Stream<…>>` subscribe (`:2054`), its quality-less values, and its
/// two unawaited `() async {…}()` loops driving `runIterate` with a bare
/// `Logger()` and no error seam (`:1364`, `:1398`). Those are the four gaps
/// this adapter exists to close.
///
/// **Two classes are called `DynamicValue` in this solve.** The binding's is
/// imported as `ua.` throughout; the relay's — the one with
/// [DynamicValue.quality] and [DynamicValue.sourceTime] as first-class fields —
/// is the unprefixed one. Every value crossing this seam goes through
/// [translateOpcUaSample], which is the adapter's entire reason for existing
/// and therefore gets its own function, its own tests and its own doc.
/// `M2400DeviceClientAdapter._mapStatus` (`state_man.dart:1277-1286`) is the
/// idiom being copied.
///
/// ## Assumption A5, recorded rather than decided
///
/// `StateMan.create(useIsolate: true)` is the app's default and keeps the
/// blocking FFI off the event loop the `LagMonitor` measures. The gateway's hot
/// path, though, is one isolate encoding once and fanning out (design §5), so
/// every isolate boundary is a copy. [useIsolate] is therefore a constructor
/// flag, defaulting to **true** — the safe half — and set false by the test
/// fixture so a leg can reach into the client. **Nothing in this phase measures
/// which is right.** That is A5, and it stays an assumption until somebody puts
/// a number on it.

///     arrives with a source timestamp. The binding already restricts the

///     not have to re-check, but a caller that starts feeding it other
///     attributes' samples will clobber a Bad code with Good.
///  2. **A Bad sample carries no payload.** `hasValue` is clear on it, so
///     `statusCode != 0` arrives with a stale-or-null value. The value is
///     therefore dropped rather than published under a bad badge: a number
///     nobody measured, rendered greyed-out, is still a number nobody measured.
///  3. **Arrival is not freshness.** A sample arriving says something reached
///     the socket; [DynamicValue.quality] is what says whether it is worth
///     reading.
///
/// When the server sends no source timestamp, [arrivedAt] is used and
/// [onSourceTimeFallback] is called — a counter or a one-time log, **not
/// silence** — and the quality is deliberately **not** degraded for it. A
/// server that omits the timestamp is not a server sending a bad reading, and
/// degrading it would make every such server permanently suspect (threat
