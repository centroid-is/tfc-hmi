/// The TimescaleDB adapter behind the [TimeseriesSink] seam — **the one file
/// in this package that knows `tfc_dart`'s `Database` exists**, which the
/// freeze suite's seam sweep enforces by counting import sites.
///
/// ## The wrap verdict, with the evidence
///
/// Phase 8 judged every incumbent on two criteria: is it testable through
/// constructor injection, and does it hold global state. `Database` passes
/// both, in favour of **wrapping**:
///
///  * *Constructor injection.* `Database(AppDatabase db, {…})`
///    (`database.dart:496-505`) takes its backend as a parameter, and
///    `AppDatabase.forTest(config, QueryExecutor)` is a public
///    `@visibleForTesting` **generative** constructor added specifically so a
///    test can subclass and override `tableExists` / `tableInsertBatch`
///    (`database_drift.dart:141-153` — its doc comment says exactly why it
///    exists). `tfc_dart`'s own `FakeWriteBackend` proves the write path is
///    unit-testable with no server anywhere, and this package's copy of it
///    drives every offline case in `timescale_sink_test.dart`.
///  * *Global state.* Three statics, none load-bearing here:
///    `Database.logger` is a `Logger`; `DatabaseConfig._configJsonCache`
///    sits only on the `fromPrefs`/SecureStorage path, which the gateway
///    never takes — its config comes from `GatewayConfig`; and
///    `_PendingWrite._nextSeq` is a monotonic counter whose whole purpose is
///    deterministic drop ordering.
///  * *What rebuilding would cost.* Type inference and the null-first-sample
///    rule (`database.dart:907-913`, `:1004-1026`), ALTER-TABLE schema
///    evolution with the null-column rule (`:1042-1082`), the BIGINT lesson
///    (`:1696-1753`), the retention clamps (`:279-319`) and per-table drop
///    accounting (`:796`, `:1085-1127`) — each with a dedicated test file
///    under `packages/tfc_dart/test/core/`. That is accumulated failure
///    knowledge with correct semantics, and unlike `StateMan` there is no
///    semantic layer above it that the relay disagrees with.
///
/// ## The retry queue is not a violation of the no-retry rule
///
/// The standing rule is *no auto-retry upstream*: a setpoint silently
/// re-applied after an operator gave up is a safety event, which is why
/// `WriteResult` has three states and readback is the only confirmation. A
/// row buffered for TimescaleDB is **not a command to the plant**. There is
/// no actuator behind it and nobody standing at a machine because of it, and
/// the failure mode of *not* retrying is the one this project actually cares
/// about: a silent hole in the history exactly across the incident somebody
/// will later be asked to explain. `Database`'s queue is bounded (10 000 rows
/// per table, 200 000 total, `database.dart:242-277`), drops oldest-first,
/// counts every drop with a reason, and `resetStats` deliberately refuses to
/// clear those counters (`:1128-1133`). The rule that applies to the
/// historian is not *no retry* — it is *no silent anything*, and this file's
/// contribution is that the counters become readable numbers in [stats]
/// rather than log lines. Do not "fix" the queue away.
///
/// ## What the wrapper refuses to inherit
///
///  1. *`connectWithRetry`'s ladder on the startup path.* It retries until it
///     succeeds — "which on a full server is never" is in its own doc — and
///     it cannot be cancelled. The connect loop here does `probe()` (bounded
///     at 5 s), then `AppDatabase.spawn`/`create` and `open()`, in a
///     background future that checks the closed flag between attempts and
///     backs off. [start] awaits none of it.
///  2. *The constructor-started flush timer.* `Database`'s constructor starts
///     a 500 ms `Timer.periodic` before the caller can say a word (`:503`,
///     `:1136-1140`). A disabled sink therefore never constructs the object
///     at all, and every test that does must `close()` in teardown. That
///     timer lives in `tfc_dart`'s `lib`, where this package's timer sweep
///     cannot see it — which is exactly why it is written down here.
///  3. *The collector's fire-and-forget insert.* `collector.dart:267` does
///     `unawaited(insertValue(value))`. This sink **awaits**
///     `insertTimeseriesData` — a buffer append in the common case — and the
///     freeze suite forbids a handlerless `unawaited(` in this directory.
///  4. *Two shutdown methods.* `dispose()` (`:1284-1298`) and `close()`
///     (`:1793-1804`) differ: only `close()` closes the pool underneath. The
///     seam exposes one method; this adapter flushes, then calls `close()`.
///
/// ## Counting honesty
///
/// [SinkStats.rowsWritten] is derived: rows handed to `Database` minus what
/// its stats still hold as queued or dropped. One corner is invisible to
/// that arithmetic: a sample skipped by the null-first-sample rule (a table
/// that does not exist yet and a value that cannot type it) is skipped by
/// `Database` without a counter. It is also the one loss that carries no
/// information — a null for a table with no type is not a datum.
