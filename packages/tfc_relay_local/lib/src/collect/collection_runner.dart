/// The value path → sink driver: one subscription per collected key, the
/// quality gate, the sample timers, retention registration, and the numbers
/// behind the six `PIPE.collect.*` keys.
///
/// ## The quality gate is this file's substantive decision
///
/// Only a **good-band** value (`band == 0`) is written. The app's collector
/// historises whatever arrives because open62541's `DynamicValue` has no
/// quality field to consult (08-RESEARCH §A.2); the gateway's values carry
/// [DynamicValue.quality] for real, so for the first time the historian can
/// decline.
///
/// **Uncertain is excluded on purpose, and the reason is
/// [Quality.uncertainLastKnown] itself**: "the last known value" is by
/// definition a value the field is no longer confirming, and inserting it at
/// `now()` manufactures a reading that never happened. A frozen value written
/// every five seconds through an upstream outage is a flat, plausible trend
/// that somebody later reads as "the line was running steady" — precisely the
/// class of lie this project exists to prevent. A gap in a trend is honest
/// and legible; a flat line is neither.
///
/// The counter is what keeps this from being a silent loss: every declined
/// sample increments the number behind [PipeKeys.collectRowsDropped], so an
/// operator asking "why is there no data between 14:02 and 14:20" gets the
/// answer from that key plus the upstream keys that were bad at the time.
/// (The originally-drafted separate skipped-quality key does not exist and
/// must not be minted: 8b-01 shipped six keys, the roster and its lane
/// partition are pinned by the protocol suite, and the dropped counter's own
/// seam doc already reads "dropped, skipped or refused".)
///
/// What this gate cannot do: the app's collector, writing the same tags with
/// no quality field, will keep filling those gaps until cutover — which is
/// exactly why the two write into disjoint `tablePrefix` namespaces until
/// then (`collection_config.dart`'s four-fact argument).
///
/// ## The pipeline order is the shipped collector's
///
/// Member extraction happens **before** anything else splits on mode, so the
/// insert path and any future real-time consumer agree on what a sample *is*
/// (`collector.dart:218-221`). Then the quality gate, then the interval
/// decision, then the insert.
///
/// ## Collection is a subscriber like any other
///
/// One [StateManApi.subscribe] per entry — the ordinary value path, no
/// private hook. That makes every collected key a permanent subscriber in
/// 08-05's refcount: a panel leaving a collected key does not release the
/// upstream subscription underneath it, deliberately and asserted
/// (T-8b-13, accepted). The replayed snapshot a subscription yields first is
/// **not a row** in change-driven mode: it is the cache replaying, not news
/// from the plant, and inserting it would stamp an old reading with a fresh
/// `now()` (T-8b-11).
///
/// ## One entry's failure costs one entry
///
/// `collector.dart:159-172` is the incident this repeats-by-not-repeating: a
/// discarded future rejecting inside the acquisition isolate killed
/// collection for the whole server and sent the supervisor into a respawn
/// loop, with a still-templated `$variable` key as the easy trigger. Here
/// every entry start is guarded, every fire-and-forget future carries a
/// handler on the same line (freeze 8 counts them), and a failure is
/// recorded against its key in [entryFailures].
