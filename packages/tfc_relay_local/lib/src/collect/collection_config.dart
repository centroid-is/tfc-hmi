/// Whether the gateway historises at all, and under whose ownership.

/// ## The side-by-side argument, with the evidence
///
/// **The next person will want to delete the prefix. Read this first.**
/// ROADMAP Phase 8b requires the gateway's collection to be side-by-side safe
/// with the app's collector while both run, and that is a design problem
/// rather than a flag, on four facts:
///
///  1. The app's collector derives its table name from `entry.name ??
///     entry.key` (`collector.dart:215`, and `CollectEntry`'s constructor
///     sets `name ??= key` at `:50`) out of the **same** `collect` blocks
///     this gateway reads — so an unprefixed gateway picks byte-identical
///     table names.
///  2. The tables carry **no primary key and no unique index** —
///     `createTable` emits a plain `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`
///     (`database_drift.dart:677-691`) and `create_hypertable(…, 'time')`
///     (`:907`) — so Postgres accepts a second writer without a murmur and
///     the row count simply doubles. Every count a panel shows doubles with
///     it, and nothing anywhere reports an error.
///  3. Retention is an **active fight**, not a passive one:
///     `registerRetentionPolicy` compares the stored policy and, on any
///     difference, calls `updateRetentionPolicy`, which runs
///     `remove_retention_policy` then `add_retention_policy`
///     (`database.dart:847-864`, `database_drift.dart:895-931`) — so two
///     collectors whose configs differ by one minute uninstall each other's
///     policy at every start.
///  4. Schema evolution types a column from whichever writer reaches it
///     first (`database.dart:1042-1082`), so two writers with two ideas of a
///     struct's shape fight over the table's columns and the loser's rows
///     are poisoned or coerced.
///
/// The `gw_` prefix keeps the two writers in two disjoint table namespaces,
/// which dissolves all four at once. An **empty** prefix is therefore refused
/// at construction unless [soleWriter] is also set — the only way for gateway
/// rows to reach the app's tables is a deliberate, two-field act.
///
/// ## The limit, honestly
///
/// The prefix protects against **the app's collector**, which cannot be asked
/// to cooperate: 08-CONTEXT ruling 3 keeps it running unchanged until app
/// integration cuts over. The advisory lock 8b-02 adds protects against a
/// **second gateway**, which can. Neither covers a third-party writer, and
/// nothing in this design pretends to.
///
/// ## The cutover procedure
///
///  1. Stop the app's collector on the collector station.
///  2. Set `soleWriter: true` in this block.
///  3. Set `tablePrefix: ''`.
///  4. Restart the gateway.
///
/// Migrating the `gw_`-prefixed history into the unprefixed tables is a
/// one-shot `INSERT INTO … SELECT` that belongs to the cutover, not to this
/// phase.
