/// The gateway's `StateManApi`: one composer over the key router, the ordered
/// upstream links and one value store.
///
/// ## Why the 2,796-line `StateMan` composer does not enter the gateway
///
/// This is the decision the whole package rests on, and it is written here by
/// line so the next reader does not have to re-derive it. `ClientWrapper`,
/// `ModbusDeviceClientAdapter` and `M2400DeviceClientAdapter` *are* wrapped —
/// they carry years of plant scar tissue (a two-phase resubscribe that fixed a
/// measured monitored-item storm, a heartbeat-derived effective status with a
/// 15 s stale / 30 s grace window, the classification that tells a transient
/// `Inactivity` from a fatal `SubscriptionDeleted`) and none of that is worth
/// rewriting. The composer above them is a different matter, and four of its
/// properties are the anti-patterns `StateManApi` exists to replace:
///
///  1. **`read` throws on every failure path**
///     (`packages/tfc_dart/lib/core/state_man.dart:1876`). A read that throws
///     is a read whose caller has to invent a quality, and an invented quality
///     is how a plausible number survives the loss of the thing producing it.
///  2. **`write` throws too** (`:2042`), which collapses "I cannot tell whether
///     it happened" into "it failed" — the one distinction the whole write path
///     exists to preserve.
///  3. **`subscribe` is a `Future<Stream<…>>`** (`:2054`), the shape
///     `state_man_api.dart:80-84` names as how a widget ends up missing the
///     first values of its own subscription.
///  4. **Its values carry no quality.** `tfc_dart`'s `DynamicValue` and this
///     package's are two different classes with one name, and only one of them
///     has `quality` and `sourceTime` as fields. Everything crossing into the
///     gateway is a translation between them, and the translation is where the
///     two facts get minted rather than lost.
///
/// ## Nothing is spawned by the constructor
///
/// `StateMan._` starts two unawaited background loops per OPC UA client
/// (`:1364`, `:1398`) with a bare `Logger()` and no error seam, in a
/// constructor. That is the shape being replaced. Here construction allocates
/// and connects nothing; [start] opens the links under a bounded deadline and
/// [dispose] closes them, so a failure to reach a PLC is a value the caller
/// receives rather than an exception raised inside somebody else's `new`.
///
/// ## Explicit delegation, never `noSuchMethod`
///
/// Every member is written out. `policy_state_man.dart:80-87` gives the reason
/// and `cert_health_state_man.dart:153-158` repeats it: a forwarder silently
/// absorbs a member added to `StateManApi` in a later phase — the new member
/// works, unpoliced, and nothing says so. Here a new member is a compile error,
/// and a compile error is a decision. `freeze_test.dart` pins the spelling out
/// of `lib/` so the shortcut cannot be taken later either.
///
/// ## The write path is here, and there is one of it
///
/// `write` is 08-06's and so is the single line that crosses into a plant
/// ([_crossIntoThePlant]). Three states, no throw to report an outcome, no
/// retry anywhere, and readback as the only confirmation — the badge on a
/// value says "sent", and only an upstream sample says "confirmed".
///
/// ## What this plan does not implement yet
///
/// `holdToRun` is 08-06 task 3's; `browse`, `timeseries`,
/// `historyViews` and `preferences` are 08-11's and Phase 10's. Each throws an
/// `UnimplementedError` naming the plan that owes it, and the count is a
/// declared constant in `freeze_test.dart` that must reach zero. This is
/// 07-01's `gateOutstanding` doctrine: a self-deleting list with an owner beats
/// a red suite, because a phase whose own gate is red cannot tell a new failure
/// from a known one.
