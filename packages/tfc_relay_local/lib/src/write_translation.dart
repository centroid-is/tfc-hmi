/// What a protocol's answer to a write *means*, as pure functions.
///
/// ## The rule this whole file implements
///
/// **Unknown is the safe default and rejected is the claim that needs
/// evidence.** "Rejected" tells an operator it is safe to press the button
/// again; a rejected that was actually applied is a second start command on a
/// machine somebody is standing next to. So `WriteRejected` is produced only
/// where a device *named* a refusal, and everything else — a timeout, a
/// channel loss, a status code with no ruling behind it, a sentence nobody
/// has taught this file to read — is [WriteUnknown].
///
/// The three states already exist as a sealed type with no throw path
/// (`write_result.dart`), and `state_man_api.dart:118-122` names the two
/// shipped lines this file is here to replace: `StateMan.write`'s
/// `Future<void>` that throws (`state_man.dart:2042-2044`) and
/// `M2400DeviceClientAdapter.write`'s `UnsupportedError` (`:1266-1268`) — a
/// read-only device answering with an exception where the honest answer is a
/// refusal.
///
/// ## Why pure functions over a descriptor, and not methods on the links
///
/// A function that takes what the protocol handed back — a status code, an
/// exception, a timeout marker — and returns a `WriteResult` is testable with
/// no device at all, which is what makes fifteen arms affordable. The adapters
/// in 08-07 and 08-10 describe what happened and ask this file what it means;
/// none of them decides for itself.
///
/// ## Which branch of 08-01 this took: the STRING FALLBACK (assumption A3)
///
/// 08-01 task 1(d) — a numeric StatusCode on the write error path — **did not
/// land**, and deliberately: `client.dart:485-494` completes the write
/// completer with a formatted `String`, and `isolate.dart` marshals every
/// error across the port as `e.toString()` (`:1078`, `:1124`, `:969`), so a
/// typed exception under `useIsolate: true` would be flattened straight back
/// to a String. Both branches are therefore implemented here:
///
///  * [WriteStatusAnswer] translates on the **code**, which is what the
///    adapters should hand over the day the binding carries one; and
///  * [WriteErrorText] parses the formatted string against a small table of
///    known code names, and **every unparsed string is unknown** — never
///    rejected. That is assumption A3's cost, and it is the safe half of it:
///    noisy, not dangerous.
///
/// ## No retry lives here and none can
///
/// These functions map one answer to one outcome. They have no reference to a
/// link, so a retry cannot be written inside them, and the package's single
/// upstream write call site is pinned by `freeze_test.dart`'s freeze 4.
