/// The per-PLC epoch: one opaque token that changes when the server underneath
/// changes.
///
/// A TwinCAT program download rebuilds the address space. NodeIds the gateway
/// resolved an hour ago may now point at a different variable, or at nothing,
/// and the failure mode is the worst one this project has a name for: a
/// plausible number on the right-looking page. SRV-07's answer is this token
/// plus one rule — a handle carrying an old token cannot answer at all — and
/// [UpstreamRef.epoch] is where that rule is enforced.
///
/// ## The epoch is OPAQUE above this file
///
/// Nothing outside this library may parse an epoch, order two of them, or read
/// a timestamp out of one. **Only equality matters.** A caller that compares
/// epochs for recency has invented a clock the plant did not agree to: the
/// inputs below include a hash, the token is versioned, and the day a fourth
/// input lands the string changes shape. Three named constants and
/// [isUnreadableEpoch] are the entire vocabulary a caller gets.
///
/// ## Three inputs, because one of them is an assumption
///
/// **Assumption A1, in full, because this is the file where a future reader
/// will look for it.**
///
/// The roadmap's F24 mechanism is *"a change in a PLC's
/// `ServerStatus.StartTime` bumps its epoch, forces re-browse, and marks its
/// keys bad-quality"*. SVN's PLCs are Beckhoff TwinCAT, which means the OPC UA
/// server is **TF6100, a separate Windows service on the controller** — and a
/// PLC program download restarts the *PLC runtime*, not that service. Beckhoff
/// documents that the server "automatically imports the first PLC runtime into
/// its namespace" on download, but neither the InfoSys pages nor the TF6100
/// manual state whether `ServerStatus.StartTime` moves, or what happens to
/// previously-issued NodeIds. **Two web searches failed to settle it either
/// way; this is a genuine gap, not a formality** (08-RESEARCH §C.2).
///
/// *What is verified:* `Server_ServerStatus_StartTime` is numeric NodeId
/// **2257** in namespace 0 — `UA_NS0ID_SERVER_SERVERSTATUS_STARTTIME = 2257` in
/// the binding's own generated table (`open62541_bindings.dart:70202`), with
/// `…CURRENTTIME = 2258` on the next line, which is the node
/// `state_man.dart:1081` already reads as a heartbeat. The OPC Foundation Part
/// 5 §12.10 page carries no numeric ids, so the generated table is the
/// authority here rather than the spec page.
///
/// *Why this design does not depend on A1:* the epoch is derived from **three**
/// independent inputs (08-CONTEXT ruling 7), any one of which changing bumps
/// it:
///
///  1. `Server_ServerStatus_StartTime` — ns=0, i=2257. Moves on a server
///     restart. Whether it moves on a PLC download is A1.
///  2. A hash of `Server_NamespaceArray` — ns=0, i=2255. A re-import can
///     renumber namespace indices, and the index is what a NodeId carries, so
///     a renumbering is a silent re-pointing of every handle. This input
///     catches it **with the TF6100 service untouched**, which is precisely
///     the case A1 might leave blind.
///  3. An optional PLC build-stamp tag, whose key comes from configuration.
///     The most reliable signal of the three and the one the integrator
///     controls; it costs one `DINT` in a program the plant already owns
///     (`~/Projects/sildarvinnsla`). Absent by default.
///
/// *What would settle A1:* a read of `ns=0;i=2257` on ST101 at
/// `10.104.29.11` before and after a program download. 08-CONTEXT calls that a
/// **nice-to-have field verification, not a blocker** — said here so nobody
/// blocks a phase on it and nobody forgets it either.
///
/// *The next lever if the field check comes back saying StartTime does not
/// move:* a **handle-validity probe** — a *cluster* of `BadNodeIdUnknown` on
/// one alias is itself evidence of a reprogram, and `AutoDisposingStream`
/// already classifies that code as permanent (`state_man.dart:2718`). Research
/// ranks it third and this plan does **not** build it. It is recorded here as
/// the named next step rather than as a TODO nobody owns.
///
/// ## Pure combination, IO separated
///
/// [EpochInputs.combine] is a pure function of three optionals and is where the
/// subtle bugs live — ordering, null handling, a hash folded over something
/// with non-deterministic iteration order. It is tested with no server at all.
/// [readEpochInputs] is the only part that touches a socket, and it is
/// deliberately one function with one bounded read helper.
