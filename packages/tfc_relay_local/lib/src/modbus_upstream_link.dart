/// The classic-Modbus and UMAS-by-name [UpstreamLink], and the machinery both
/// `DeviceClient`-backed adapters share.
///
/// **Wrap, do not rebuild.** `ModbusDeviceClientAdapter` is 1,506 lines sitting
/// on top of a 3,325-line `UmasClient`, with forty-odd dedicated test files
/// behind it. What is in there is not cleverness, it is *accumulated failure
/// knowledge*: the sticky M580 detection that skips a wasted `0x22 → 0xA1`
/// probe on every reconnect (TD-009), the single shared MonitorPlc table with
/// per-poll-group timers because the protocol allows exactly one table per
/// session (B-4), the symbol cache, the bit-mask read-modify-write, the
/// endianness matrix. Re-deriving that at the same fidelity is not a phase, and
/// every place it would be re-derived wrong is a plant behaviour nobody would
/// notice until a shift went bad.
///
/// What is *not* inherited is the layer above it — `StateMan`, whose `read` and
/// `write` throw, whose `subscribe` is a `Future<Stream<…>>`, and whose values
/// carry neither a quality nor a source time. Those are the semantics this
/// adapter exists to replace, and they live one layer up from everything worth
/// keeping. The seam is clean below and dirty above.
///
/// ## The timers, said out loud
///
/// The wrapped adapter owns several `Timer.periodic`s — a listener-gated health
/// timer (`modbus_device_client.dart:173`) and one per UMAS poll group, started
/// on connect and stopped on disconnect (`:393-395`, `:492-508`). **That is not
/// a violation of the day-one timer freeze**, which scopes `tfc_relay_local`'s
/// own `lib` and counts timers *this* package constructs. Wrapping a class that
/// owns timers does not construct one here. This paragraph exists so that a
/// future reader running the freeze sweep and finding four timers alive in the
/// process does not "fix" it by tearing the poll groups out of the adapter,
/// which would silently stop every UMAS-by-name key on the plant.
///
/// ## Two classes are called `DynamicValue`
///
/// The binding's is imported as `ua.`; the relay's — the one with a
/// [DynamicValue.quality] and a [DynamicValue.sourceTime] — is unprefixed.
/// [DeviceClientUpstreamLink.translateSample] is the one crossing point.
///
/// ## Where the shared base lives, and why here
///
/// [DeviceClientUpstreamLink] is in this file rather than in one of its own
/// because 08-10's file list is two adapters and an encoding module, and a
/// third source file for ~250 lines of shared cache/degrade/epoch bookkeeping
/// would be a filing decision made by a plan that did not make it. Modbus is
/// the first of the two `DeviceClient` wrappers, so the shared half sits with
/// it and `m2400_upstream_link.dart` imports it. If a third `DeviceClient`
/// protocol ever arrives, move it then.
