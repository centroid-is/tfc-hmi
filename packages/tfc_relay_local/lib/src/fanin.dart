/// One upstream subscription per key, however many clients are watching it,
/// released when the last one goes.
///
/// ## Where the counter lives, and why not on the node
///
/// The mechanism is half-built already. `ValueStore.node(key)` returns the
/// *same* `ValueStoreNode` for the same key
/// (`packages/tfc_relay_protocol/lib/src/value_store.dart:186-187`) and
/// `ValueStoreNode.listenerCount` is public (`:118`), so the count of who is
/// watching a key is a fact the store could answer. But **there is no
/// `onListen`/`onCancel` hook on a node**: `addListener` is
/// `_listeners.add(listener)` and nothing more (`:66`), so nothing there can
/// fire at the transitions that matter.
///
/// 08-RESEARCH §B.2 weighs both repairs and recommends this one:
///
///  * *(a)* add the two hooks to `ValueStoreNode` — a change in
///    `tfc_relay_protocol`, which is the frozen wire package the client, the
///    server and this gateway all agree through. A subscription lifecycle is
///    not a wire shape, and putting one there makes every future consumer of
///    the store inherit a callback it did not ask for.
///  * *(b)* hold the count **here**, in a map keyed by key, incremented and
///    decremented on a handle the subscribe path returns. The wire package
///    stays untouched and the release point is explicit rather than emergent —
///    it is a line of code with a name, not a side effect of somebody's
///    `removeListener`.
///
/// (b) it is.
///
/// ## Release at zero, not on a ten-minute idle timer
///
/// The incumbent `AutoDisposingStream` releases its upstream subscription on an
/// **idle timer defaulting to ten minutes** after the last listener goes
/// (`packages/tfc_dart/lib/core/state_man.dart:2674-2676`, `:2770-2785`).
/// SRV-07 says released when the last subscriber unsubscribes, and it is right:
/// a page close should stop costing the PLC a monitored item, not keep costing
/// it for ten minutes while the operator is somewhere else.
///
/// Two of the incumbent's shapes are explicitly **not** inherited:
///
///  * **The spent-entry semantics** (`:2691`, `:2731-2751`). It closes its
///    subject when the raw stream ends and hands a new listener the replay
///    buffer followed by `done`, which to a widget is indistinguishable from a
///    key that simply stopped updating. Here the end of an upstream stream is
///    reported through [FanIn.onUpstreamEnded] as a *quality*, and the store
///    node stays alive.
///  * **The by-key eviction race**, which the incumbent's own comment names
///    (`:2736-2739`): its idle timer removes **by key**, so a timer surviving
///    into the next subscription for that key evicts the live entry that
///    replaced it. Here a new [FanIn.attach] cancels the armed timer, and the
///    timer's callback additionally refuses to act on an entry that is no
///    longer the one the map holds or that has picked up a subscriber. Two
///    guards, because the sabotage that removes one must fail.
///
/// ## Epochs
///
/// A key is resolved **once per epoch**, at the moment its refcount leaves
/// zero, and the [UpstreamRef] the link minted is held for the life of the
/// subscription. Nothing here re-resolves inside an epoch — the handle is
/// already epoch-stamped and the link refuses a superseded one itself
/// (`upstream_link.dart`, SRV-07). Re-resolution belongs *after* an
/// `epochStream` event, and **08-08 owns that wiring**: it is a subscription
/// this class does not take out, deliberately, so that the re-subscribe policy
/// is written once with the epoch tests that judge it rather than twice.
