/// The weigher [UpstreamLink]: read-only by protocol, and the clearest case
/// this project has for existing at all.
///
/// **Why the smallest adapter matters most.** `M2400DeviceClientAdapter` is
/// fifty-five lines (`state_man.dart:1235-1302`). The device behind it accepts
/// **exactly one TCP client** — which is why `M2400Proxy` exists in `jbtm`, and
/// why the plant runs eight weighers on 10.104.29.71–78 with one connection
/// each to share out. Everything else in this repository can be argued as an
/// optimisation; this one cannot. The gateway is the one process that talks to
/// the weigher, and every panel reads it through the pipe. A panel that opens
/// its own socket does not get a slow read — it takes somebody else's.
///
/// ## Read-only is a refusal, never a throw
///
/// `M2400DeviceClientAdapter.write` throws `UnsupportedError`
/// (`state_man.dart:1266-1268`), and `state_man_api.dart:114-117` names that
/// throw as what not to copy. The distinction is not pedantry: a throw on the
/// write path reads to the operator as *"the write failed"*, and a refusal to
/// try is the one thing that proves nothing about the plant. So the answer is a
/// [WriteRejected] carrying [notWritableReason] — the same object the cert
/// overlay's refusal uses (`cert_health_state_man.dart:411-424`), so that the
/// gateway has **one spelling** of `Bad_NotWritable` rather than two that an
/// operator would have to tell apart.
///
/// The refusal happens in [DeviceClientUpstreamLink.write]'s
/// `supportsWrites` short-circuit, which is *above* `performWrite`, so the
/// throwing adapter method is never reached. That is deliberate and is why
/// there is no `try` around it: the safe behaviour comes from not calling it,
/// not from catching it.
