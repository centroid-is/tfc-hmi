///
/// **This is deliberately not a registry of rows.** 11-RESEARCH §F.1 says it
/// in one sentence — *the soak must not have a manifest of rows* — because a
/// row table is the gate's shape, and copying it here would recreate gate A at
/// length instead of adding the thing the soak exists for. Gates A and B keep
/// the per-scenario evidence, one case per catalogue line. What the soak owns
/// is that those behaviours survive being **interleaved** for thirty-five
/// minutes, and the artifact analogous to `gate_manifest_test.dart`'s row
/// audit is therefore this file's two lists:
///
///  * [declaredCheckers] — the five invariants plus the divergence ledger,
///    audited by `judgedSamples >= minimumSamplesForAVerdict` rather than by a
///    row count, and swept in reverse so that a sixth checker cannot appear
///    without the audit knowing about it.
///  * [soakDeviations] — every place this phase does something other than what
///    `relay-websocket-notes.md` §7.8 literally says, with the clause quoted
///    **verbatim**, the number used instead, and the argument.
///
/// **Why the deviations are seeded on day one rather than collected at the
/// end.** 09-01 put its registry first and 07-13 explains why: a departure
/// applied silently is a departure the next reader believes never happened,
/// and by the end of a phase nobody can reconstruct which of the numbers in
/// the code were chosen and which were inherited. All five below were decided
/// at the discuss gate (11-CONTEXT rulings 2 and 3) or forced by a measurement
/// somebody already made, and every one of them is written down before a
/// single fault fires.
///
/// **None of the five is a descope.** Two of them (2 and 3) are *measured
/// refutations* of the catalogue text in the gate-A sense: §7.8 asks for
/// something this repository has already proved cannot be asserted honestly,
/// and the entry carries the measurement that proves it. The other three are
/// scope statements — a duration, a platform and a deployment tier — each of
/// which changes where the evidence comes from and none of which changes what
/// is being claimed.
///
/// The counts are **not** in this file. `soak_manifest_test.dart` writes down
/// how many entries and how many checker names it expects, for
/// `gate_manifest_test.dart:44-50`'s reason: a sweep that derives both sides
/// of its comparison from the same source asserts nothing, and an entry
/// deleted here would take its own count with it.
