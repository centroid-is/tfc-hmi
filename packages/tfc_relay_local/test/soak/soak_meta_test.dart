/// The checkers' own instruments, proved against fixtures rather than against
/// a storm — and the positive controls that make each of them fail on demand.
///
/// **Why this file exists next to `soak_test.dart`.** A checker is an
/// instrument, and an instrument nobody has ever seen deflect is a green tick
/// with no warrant behind it. `soak_test.dart` runs the storm and asserts the
/// invariants hold; this file asserts that the things asserting them *can
/// report a breach*. 11-01's whole argument about vacuity applies one level up:
/// an invariant that cannot fail and an invariant that held look identical in a
/// run report.
///
/// **Everything here is seconds-scale.** The unit arms drive the checkers
/// through the two narrow interfaces in `soak_observables.dart` with fixtures
/// that hold still, and the two arms that need a real pipe use
/// `SoakDriver.start()` without `play()` — a composed gateway, five real panels
/// over real sockets, and no thirty-five-minute storm behind it. A control that
/// costs a full run is a control somebody eventually stops running.
///
/// **What the fixtures are allowed to be.** A control replaces an *answer* and
/// never the stack that produced it. The live control below blackholes a real
/// panel through its real `FaultProxy`, lets the real client's real watchdog
/// notice, and then lies about exactly one verdict — which is the closest this
/// lane can get to 07-REVIEW CR-01's own defect. See [_LyingPanelView] for what
/// it is a substitute for and why the real thing is unavailable in CI.
