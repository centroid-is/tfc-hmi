///
/// The analogue of `gate_manifest_test.dart` one level up, with the row table
/// deliberately absent (11-RESEARCH §F.1). What this file audits is the two
/// things the soak's registry actually holds — the six checker names and the
/// declared departures from §7.8 — plus, from 11-01 task 2, the vacuity gate
/// that makes a checker's green mean something.
///
/// **The counts live here, not in the registry.** [_declaredDeviations] and
/// [_declaredCheckerNames] are written down in this file on purpose, which is
/// `gate_manifest_test.dart:44-50`'s argument: a sweep that derives both sides
/// of its comparison from the same source asserts nothing. An entry deleted
/// from `soakDeviations` takes its own `.length` with it and every in-file
/// count still agrees with itself; these two numbers are the only place the
/// deletion shows.
///
/// **The print is the point.** Later phases and the milestone audit read the
/// deviations block out of a run report rather than out of the source, so it
/// goes to stdout on every run whether or not anything below fails — the same
/// reason `gate_manifest_test.dart:597-601` gives.
///
/// **Why the clause cannot be machine-checked against the catalogue.** Gate A
/// asserts that each deviation's clause is a substring of its row's
/// `verbatimText`, which works because the catalogue text is embedded in
/// `f_row_registry.dart`. §7.8 lives in `relay-websocket-notes.md`, which is
/// **not in the repository** — it is a working document on the author's
/// machine. So the [SoakDeviation.clause] field *is* the embedded copy, and
/// the floor this file can enforce is that it exists and is not a paraphrase
/// of nothing. Quoting it verbatim is a discipline the reviewer checks, not
/// one a sweep can.
