/// The five structural promises this package makes on day one.
///
/// These properties are *the reason* `LocalStateMan` is a new package rather
/// than five hundred more lines inside `tfc_relay_server`. That package pins
/// itself at exactly one repeating timer (`teardown_test.dart:495-540`) and it
/// is right to: one tick engine over one registry, and a second periodic timer
/// there would double every client's frame rate and halve the value of every
/// backpressure verdict. This package genuinely needs three — a `runIterate`
/// driver, a freshness sweep and a fan-in linger — and the honest answer to
/// that is a **named allow-list of its own**, not an exemption bolted onto
/// somebody else's sweep until their property means nothing.
///
/// So the promises are written down here, before there is anything to enforce
/// them against, and each one is proven to be *looking*. Three rules the file
/// follows, and the reasons are not stylistic:
///
///  1. **Every sweep takes its directory as an argument.** That is what makes
///     the empty-temp-directory falsification arm possible at all — a sweep
///     that hard-codes its own path cannot be pointed at a tree that is known
///     to contain nothing, so nothing can ever demonstrate that it counts.
///     `mode_integrity_test.dart:379`'s `_proofFiles(Directory)` is the shape.
///  2. **Every number is declared here**, as a `const` with a comment saying
///     what would legitimately move it — never derived from the thing it is
///     counting, because a count that recomputes its own expectation agrees
///     with every future.
///  3. **Anti-vacuity comes before the count.** Directory exists → directory
///     holds `.dart` files → the same sweep over an empty temp directory
///     reports zero → *then* the count
///     (`no_retry_test.dart:327-364`, `handler_table_test.dart:289-296`,
///     `teardown_test.dart:496-499` all learned this the same way).
///
/// Several counts were **zero on day one**, because on day one this package was
/// one interface file. A case named "no timer outside the allow-list" that
/// passes over a tree with no timers in it is a case nobody should trust
/// without its empty-directory sibling, so the ones that are still zero say so
/// out loud in their names rather than letting a future reader mistake an
/// empty tree for a clean one. 08-05 moved four of them off zero.

///  * `OpcUaUpstreamLink.connect` — `client.connect(endpoint)`, bounded.

///    disconnected PLC pends the caller forever (T-08-10). `ClientWrapper`
///    does not bound it either, which is why the bound is applied at the

///    counted again below.

/// It moves **by a number somebody wrote down** — every one of those call
/// sites has to carry a `deadline` argument or a `.timeout(`, and the offender

///    throwing read, so a deadline cannot go missing on one of them and stay
///    present on the others. The epoch is the detector for a server that
///    changed underneath our handles; a detector that can hang is not one.
///
///  * **08-11 added the eighth:** `OpcUaAddressSpace.detailOf`'s
///    `client.read(nodeId)`, the browse panel's detail read, bounded by that
///    address space's own `deadline`. It arrived unbounded and **this sweep is

/// requires the word `await` on the line, so a **non-awaited** upstream call

///    than deleting the native client out from under an in-flight connect (a
///    measured SEGV, 08-07). Bounded on its own line.
///  * `DeviceClientUpstreamLink.performWrite` — `client.write(...)`, a one-line
///    **seam** whose single caller is fourteen lines below it and applies
///    `.timeout(deadline)` there. The bound is one frame up, at the one pinned
///    crossing (`declaredUpstreamWriteSites`), and moving it into the seam
///    would give the overriding subclasses two places to lose it.
///  * `DeviceClientUpstreamLink.connect` — `client.connect()`, which is

///    `void connect() => wrapper.connect()`. There is nothing to await, nothing
