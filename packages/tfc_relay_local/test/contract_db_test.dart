/// The fifth contract leg: the same fifty checks, over a **real TimescaleDB**.
///
/// ## What this leg is for, in one sentence
///
/// `contract_test.dart` runs the whole suite against `LocalStateMan` with
/// `supportsDataServices: false`, because a gateway composed without a
/// database has no historian, no saved views and no preference store. This
/// file is the same subject with the database put back, so the seven
/// data-services checks stop being skipped and start being judged — in
/// process, against Postgres, with no wire anywhere.
///
/// ## A FLAG, not a LIST — and the difference matters
///
/// Two different mechanisms retire the two kinds of gap this phase closes, and
/// confusing them sends a reader looking for something that never existed.
///
///  * The **socket legs** empty a *list*. `channel_full_contract_test.dart`,
///    `socket_contract_test.dart` and `ws_contract_test.dart` each carried an
///    `expectUnreachable` set naming thirteen checks, and each of those
///    sentences asserted that the method answered JSON-RPC `-32601`. 10-02
///    through 10-05 removed them a batch at a time as the handlers landed.
///  * **This leg** raises a *boolean*. It never had a list and could not have
///    had one: `expectUnreachable` passes a case only by failing with exactly
///    `-32601`, and an in-process implementation has no wire, no envelope and
///    no error code to produce with. 08-11 wrote `supportsDataServices: false`
///    with that reason at the call site; this file is the result.
///
/// So there is no gap list here to find retired, and looking for one is Trap 4.
/// The flag is the whole record.
///
/// ## Why the database-free leg stays
///
/// The plan's rule decides it: **`dart test --exclude-tags db` must not need a
/// database.** `contract_test.dart` is that lane's contract coverage and keeps
/// `supportsDataServices: false`, which is not a gap being tolerated but a true
/// statement about a gateway with no `collection:` block — the ordinary
/// deployment, and the one `LocalStateMan.timeseries` refuses by name. This
/// file is additive: the same fifty checks over the same class, with the three
/// services composed in. Replacing the pure leg with this one would have put a
/// TimescaleDB behind every offline run of the package.
///
/// ## The fakes are not deleted
///
/// `fake_data_services.dart:11-18` says what has to survive their replacement
/// is the contract, not the code, and the fakes stay for two live reasons:
/// they are `parity_test.dart:107`'s reference leg, and they are the sabotage
/// baseline — an arm that breaks the database implementation has to be able to
/// show the same check still passing against something.
///
/// ## Sharing a database with 8b, and with the other Phase 10 db legs
///
/// Every timeseries table this file touches carries the `gw_` prefix and a
/// per-run random suffix, and `tearDownAll` drops what it created — the same
/// rule `timeseries_read_test.dart` and 8b's `side_by_side_test.dart` follow,
/// and the reason the two phases can point at one server.
///
/// `flutter_preferences` and the four history-view tables cannot be prefixed:
/// they are drift's own schema and the contract's preference keys are literal
/// strings inside the kit. Those rows are deleted by name in `setUp` and
/// `tearDownAll` instead. See the SUMMARY's note on the residual cross-suite
/// hazard in `TIMESCALEDB_EXTERNAL` mode, where every db suite shares one
/// server rather than getting its own container.
