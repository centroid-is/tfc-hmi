/// The fourth contract leg: the same suite, over the gateway's plant side —
/// and the database-free one. `contract_db_test.dart` is the fifth, the same
/// fifty checks over the same class with a real TimescaleDB behind it; the two
/// share `buildHarnessedLocalStateMan` so they cannot drift into judging
/// different subjects.
///
/// Three implementations already pass it — the reference fake, the in-memory
/// channel and the real WebSocket. This is the fourth and the first with a
/// plant behind it, which is the moment `LocalStateMan` stops being this
/// phase's code and becomes an implementation of the interface the whole
/// project is built around.
///
/// The kit was designed for exactly this. `browseFixture` is a parameter
/// *"because a gateway browsing a real ST101 over OPC UA passes its own"*
/// (`tfc_stateman_contract.dart`), and `StateManHarness` is declared in the kit
/// rather than in any implementation so the kit keeps its defining property: it
/// imports no implementation, and the factory below is the only coupling to
/// one.
///
/// **One fake upstream link.** 08-CONTEXT ruling 8, and the conflicting pair of
/// freshness checks that forced it, are written out in
/// `support/harnessed_local_state_man.dart`. The per-alias half of the property
/// is `link_loss_test.dart`'s (08-09). Both; neither substitutes.
///
/// **Why the counts are asserted and not the greenness.** Copied from
/// `ws_contract_test.dart`, because the argument transfers unchanged: a harness
/// has one cheap way to look green, and it is to declare a capability false.
/// So two numbers from two different places — what the umbrella *registered*
/// under the flags it was given, and what the runner actually *started* — are
/// both compared against a number the kit computes, never against a literal,
/// *"because a literal is a number somebody updates to match"*.

      //
      // 08-11 wrote this `false` because nothing existed behind it: Phase 10
      // owned timeseries, history views and preferences, and `LocalStateMan`'s
      // three getters threw an `UnimplementedError` naming `10-01` as the plan
      // that owed them. All three landed — the reader in 10-07, the view store
      // in 10-08, the preference store and its change feed in 10-09 — and
      // `freeze_test.dart`'s `declaredUnimplementedMembers` is **0** because of
      // it. `contract_db_test.dart` (10-11) runs this same suite with the flag
      // **true** against a real TimescaleDB, all fifty checks, empty gap list.
      //
      // So this `false` is no longer a gap. It is a true statement about the
      // subject *this* leg composes: a gateway with no `collection:` block, no
      // database object at all, which is the ordinary deployment and the one
      // `LocalStateMan.timeseries` refuses by name rather than answering with
      // an empty chart. The rule that decides it is the plan's:
      // **`dart test --exclude-tags db` must not need a database**, and this
      // file is that lane's contract coverage.
      //
      // **A FLAG, not a LIST, and the difference is the one thing to carry
      // away** (Trap 4). The socket legs each emptied an `expectUnreachable`
      // set of thirteen sentences asserting JSON-RPC `-32601`, retired batch by
      // batch across 10-02..10-05. This leg never had one and could not have:
      // `expectUnreachable` passes a case *only* by failing with exactly
      // `-32601`, and an in-process peer has no wire, no envelope and no error
      // code to produce with. There is no gap list here to find retired; the
      // flag is the whole record, and looking for the list is looking for
      // something that never existed.
      //
      // The consequence is arithmetic and is asserted below: this leg
      // registers `allContractChecks.length` minus the seven data-services
      // cases, and the gap is pinned BY NAME so a second capability quietly
      // going false cannot hide inside the same number.
      //
      // The fakes in `fake_data_services.dart` are **not** deleted by any of
      // this. `:11-18` says what must survive their replacement is the
      // contract and not the code, and they have two live jobs: they are
      // `parity_test.dart:107`'s reference leg, and they are the sabotage
      // baseline — an arm that breaks the database implementation has to be
      // able to show the same check still passing against something.
