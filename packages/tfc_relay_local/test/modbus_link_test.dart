/// open62541 `Server` and is excluded from Windows for it; this file needs a
/// `DeviceClient`, which is an interface, so the whole thing runs on the vm

/// ## Why the shared group can run here and could not run against OPC UA
///
/// 08-07's named refutation stands: `UpstreamLinkDriver`'s levers are
/// synchronous `void` methods whose result the cases read on the very next
/// statement, and nothing backed by a socket can honour that. This subject is
/// backed by a `DeviceClient` **double**, which is in-memory, so every lever
/// is genuinely synchronous and the group is genuinely judging the adapter.
///
/// What it is judging is the adapter's *surface* — resolve, peek, read, the
/// deadline, the write states, the degradation, the band guard, the epoch —
/// and not its wire translation, which is what the second half of this file
/// covers with real `ua.DynamicValue` samples. The two halves together are the
