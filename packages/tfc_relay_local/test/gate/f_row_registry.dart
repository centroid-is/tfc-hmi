/// The resilience catalogue's Phase 9 rows — F22-F28 — in the tree, as data.
///
/// **Why this file exists.** The F1-F28 scenario catalogue lives in
/// `relay-websocket-notes.md` §7.5-7.9 at the main checkout root. That file is
/// untracked, so it is absent from every worktree an executor or a reviewer
/// ever opens, and STATE.md has carried "phases 7, 9 and 11 need it on hand"
/// as a standing concern since Phase 5. This file is the in-tree copy of the
/// rows Phase 9 gates: F22-F28 transcribed character-for-character from
/// 09-PATTERNS §0's embedded §7.9 table, plus — new for gate B — the §7.9
/// prose items those seven rows compress, because three of the phase's seeded
/// deviations descope clauses the Expect column never spells out and a
/// deviation is only checkable against text nobody paraphrased.
///
/// **Why this is a SECOND registry, physically separate from gate A's**
/// (`packages/tfc_relay_client/test/gate/f_row_registry.dart`), rather than
/// seven rows appended there:
///
///  1. No `package:` URI reaches another package's `test/` directory, so a
///     case in this package could not import a registry that lives in that
///     one — the rows have to be data beside the cases that quote them.
///  2. Gate A's `_declaredRows = 27` and its empty-`gateOutstanding`
///     assertion are Phase 7's closing condition and RES-01's evidence.
///     Growing either would retroactively un-close a finished phase.
///  3. Gate A's strangers arm already says, in the tree today, that *"An F22
///     here belongs in Phase 9"* — its manifest rejects these rows by name.
///     That is not an accident to work around; it is the instruction.
///
/// The [GateRow.expectation] and [GateRow.injection] strings are deliberately
/// **not** wrapped across adjacent literals. A wrapped literal is
/// byte-identical at runtime and not byte-identical on disk, and the whole
/// value of this file is that `grep -F 'every other key keeps flowing'` finds
/// the same bytes in the catalogue, in this registry and in the case that
/// quotes it.
///
/// **Five declarations, five jobs.**
///
/// [gateRows] is the catalogue. [catalogueProse] is the §7.9 prose behind it,
/// keyed by row. [gateOutstanding] is what the phase has not delivered yet,
/// one entry per undelivered row, each naming the plan that owes it — every
/// plan deletes its own entries in the same commit that lands its rows, and
/// 09-09 asserts the map is empty. [gateDeviations] is the part that keeps
/// the gate honest: every catalogue clause the phase's green does **not**
/// cover, with the measurement or the ruling and where it goes instead.
/// [followUpDestinations] is the closed set a deviation may send a clause to.
///
/// **Why an outstanding list rather than a red suite.** A permanently red
/// test makes every intermediate plan's phase gate red, and a phase whose own
/// gate is red cannot tell a new failure from a known one — the run report
/// stops being read, which is the failure mode the gate exists to prevent one
/// level up. So the red list is produced once, by running the manifest with
/// this map emptied, and recorded verbatim in 09-01-SUMMARY.md; after that

  'F22': '**Gateway event-loop stall = synchronized false disconnect on every client.** Ignition\'s forum is full of it: a Veeam/VMware snapshot froze the gateway 42 s, "tag subscriptions timed out all over the place", tags stuck erred *until manually toggled*. A Dart gateway is one isolate — more exposed than the JVM, and the trigger recurs nightly at backup time. Rules: event-loop lag monitor (alarm > 1 s drift, expose as a `PIPE.` key); heavy work (history queries, bulk encode) off-isolate; after a stall the gateway *announces* "frozen N ms" on resync so clients and historian distinguish it from a network drop. Ask what the host backup strategy is before go-live.',
  'F23': '**Ghost sessions leak PLC monitored items.** A wash-down power-cycled panel sends nothing on death; its subscription set and OPC UA monitored items linger. PLCs have hard monitored-item caps, so weeks of nightly reboots later, *new* clients fail to subscribe — a symptom with no visible link to the cause. Rules: heartbeat-driven session expiry with full teardown; refcount monitored items across clients (N clients watching one tag = one upstream item); per-client resource counts as `PIPE.` keys.',
  'F24': '**PLC program download rebuilds the NodeId space — cached-handle reads succeed and return the wrong tag\'s value.** No error, no bad quality, a weigher showing a conveyor\'s speed. Four independently-downloadable PLCs. The client↔gateway epoch (§7.5 F18) doesn\'t cover this boundary — it needs a second, per-PLC epoch: read `ServerStatus.StartTime` on session activation; if changed, drop the NodeId cache, re-browse, mark affected keys bad until re-established. Resolve by browse path / string NodeId, never cached numeric NodeIds across a session boundary.',
  'F25': '**Dead subscription on a live connection.** Home Assistant wall-dashboard failure: screen looks healthy, *some* widgets update, others are hours stale — whole-connection liveness cannot see it by construction. Rule: per-subscription sequence + last-evaluated stamp; a third UI state ("this value stopped") distinct from link-down.',
  'F26': '**Momentary buttons: the release that never arrives.** Field consensus: never set-on-press/clear-on-release. Hold-to-run = rolling-counter deadman at fixed rate, PLC runs only while the counter advances; discrete commands = HMI sets, **PLC clears**. `onTapCancel`, app-lifecycle change and connection loss all count as release.',
  'F27': '**Link-restore floods + the animation trap.** Losing one of four PLCs must raise *one* alarm, not flip every dependent alarm twice — master-inhibit: `PIPE.upstream.<alias>.connected` wired into alarm *evaluation*, not just the UI. Comms alarms get 30–120 s on-delay. Ack state is gateway-authoritative — a reconnecting client adopts it, never replays its own. An alarm re-arming after a blip is a *new occurrence* with a new id. And above N active alarms the overview switches from per-symbol blinking to a static count — the Ignition forum documents CPU collapse from alarm animations exactly at peak alarm count, and the eLinux panels have far less GPU headroom than dev machines.',
  'F28': '**`jsonEncode` throws on NaN/±Infinity** — it does not emit `null` like JS. One open-circuit 4–20 mA input or a divide-by-zero in a weigher rate calc (kg/min when the belt stops) fails the *entire batch for every client*. And `1e999` silently *decodes* to Infinity — a poison value that enters quietly and detonates on re-encode. Rule: sanitize at the OPC UA boundary, not the JSON boundary — non-finite double → `null` value + a "non-finite" quality code. Property-test the round trip (NaN, ±Inf, ±0.0, maxFinite, subnormals); fuzz the decoder with `1e999`. **`utf8.decode` throws on Latin-1 bytes.** S7 `STRING` is a byte array with no declared encoding (in practice CP1252); þ/ð/æ/ö in product names and alarm text are the *normal case* here … Fixtures say "Þorskflök í raspi", not "test string 1".',
