/// F22 — Gateway stall: a synchronized false disconnect on every client.
///
/// Catalogue §7.9, verbatim on one line each so a `grep -F` finds the same
/// bytes in the registry and here:
///
///   Injection:  SIGSTOP gateway 45 s; 5 clients, 3 upstreams
///   Expect:     every value returns to good quality unaided (Ignition's bug:
///               stuck until hand-toggled); historian marks the gap; clients
///               shown "gateway stalled", not "you disconnected"
///
/// **What this file delivers.** This file gates the whole row: the
/// announcement (F22a), the operator sentence (F22b), staleness-that-clears-
/// unaided (F22c), the reaper clause (F22d, 09-08) — the row's headline
/// "synchronized false disconnect on every client", reproduced by our own
/// reaper rather than by the freeze if `tickOnce`'s wake-up sweep blames the
/// panels for the gateway's own silence — and, since 09-09, the historian
/// clause (F22e): the freeze is a hole in the history, never a flat line,
/// asserted by one SQL query over a window spanning the freeze against a real
/// TimescaleDB. F22e is `db`-tagged PER CASE (the rest of the file stays in
/// the pure-Dart lane) and rides 8b-03's env-addressed `timescale_fixture` —
/// 09-CONTEXT ruling 2's arm, taken rather than its fallback.
///
/// **The arm letters are delivery order, not clause order.** The plan named
/// these arms a/b/d, reserving c for the reaper clause. The frozen manifest's
/// arm-letter sweep (`gate_b_manifest_test.dart`, "arm letters are unique and
/// gapless") requires the delivered arms to run a, b, c with no gap, so the
/// staleness arm the plan calls F22d is lettered F22c here; the reaper and
/// historian take the next free letters when 09-08 and 09-09 land. The clause
/// identity is preserved in each case's doc and in the outstanding entry.
///
/// **The honest lever, and the two things it decides** (the plan's `<house_
/// rules>`, restated). Whatever is being frozen cannot be the thing observing:
/// `stall_harness.dart` puts the gateway, its three upstreams and a
/// self-driving plant in one isolate this file can `Isolate.pause`, and the
/// panels stay in the test isolate. The capability probe below re-measures on
/// THIS platform what a paused isolate that owns a listening socket does —
/// assumption A3 — because the in-repo pause number (07-RESEARCH §A.4) was
/// taken on a client isolate with no socket.
///
/// **The measured client fact that shapes every arm.** A `RemoteStateMan`'s
/// `viewIsStale` and its reconnect fire on ONE timer
/// (`freshness_watchdog.dart:392` — `_linkWentQuiet` sets `_viewIsStale` and
/// then calls `onQuiet`). So a panel whose `freshnessDeadline` is shorter than
/// the freeze goes stale AND tears its socket down, and on resume it reconnects
/// fresh — it never sees the `gateway_stalled` resync, which the gateway pushes
/// to the session it still holds. A panel whose deadline outlasts the freeze
/// stays connected and receives the announcement but never reports
/// `viewIsStale`. Measured on this harness: a 3 s-deadline panel over a ~10 s
/// pause went `viewIsStale`/`down`/`connecting` at 3 s and recovered unaided on
/// resume with zero complaints; a 30 s-deadline panel stayed `ready` through
/// the pause and recorded the resync. The two are mutually exclusive per
/// panel, so **F22b (the sentence, on connected panels) and F22c (staleness,
/// on short-deadline panels) are different cases**, not one — the plan's "assert
/// them together" is unrepresentable in this client, and the SUMMARY records
/// the measurement. They are still the pair the row is about: stale-and-
/// recovering is the honest state, and it is a different state from being told
/// the gateway stalled — which is itself different from a link-down banner.
///
/// **`PIPE.*` health-key homes** (08-09's F22 exemption). The per-link keys
/// (`PipeKeys.upstreamConnected`/`upstreamState`) are the LOCAL package's,
/// minted by `LocalStateMan` inside the frozen isolate; the per-session keys
/// are the server's. This file reads plant keys and the per-link keys, both of
/// which live in the frozen isolate — so during the freeze they too stop
/// advancing, which is the point. No case here reads a per-session health key.
