/// Catalogue §7.9, verbatim on one line each so a `grep -F` finds the same
/// bytes in the registry and here:
///
///   Injection:  hold jog, then (a) pull cable (b) kill app (c) background app
///   Expect:     machine stops in all three — deadman counter stops advancing
///
/// **Why a stopped counter stops the machine, quoted from the PLC contract.**
/// `relay-comm-design.md` §4.6a carries `FB_HoldToRun` with `Deadman : TON;
/// // PT := T#1000MS`, and *"The counter CHANGING is the signal. Its value
/// carries no meaning"* — `Run := Permissive AND (Counter <> 0) AND NOT
/// Deadman.Q`. So the machine runs only while the counter advances, and the
/// safety this row asserts is exactly that the counter on the plant tag
/// **stops advancing** when the panel holding it is gone. That `T#1000MS` is
/// the PLC's own deadman and the safety authority; this phase measures the
/// gateway's behaviour against it and adds no second timeout to the safety
/// path (09-CONTEXT ruling 3).
///
/// **The observable is the plant tag, read off the fake link — never the
/// client.** The gateway mints the counter and discards the wire's `n`
/// (`value_handlers.dart:180-185`, §4.6a), so a client-supplied number is the
/// wrong thing to assert on. Every arm reads the counter through
/// [_plantTag], which is what the PLC would see.
///
/// **Three deaths, one control.** Each injection is a different way for the
/// panel to stop being there — the link blackholed, the isolate killed, the
/// isolate paused — and each is judged the same way: the counter freezes at
/// once, and the tag reads 0 within a bound read off the gateway's own config
/// and printed. A second session holding a **different** key ticks through
/// every injection (one session may hold one live hold per key, 05-REVIEW
/// WR-02, so it must be a different key), and its counter keeps advancing —
/// without it, an arm would pass whenever the fixture ended every hold for
/// everyone, which is the vacuous form of this row.
///
/// The panel-isolate harness (`support/panel_isolate.dart`) is a copy of
/// `suspend_harness.dart`'s pattern: the plant and the gateway stay in this
/// isolate and only the panel moves, so the deadman counter is an ordinary
/// in-process read while the panel that dies is a real second isolate.
