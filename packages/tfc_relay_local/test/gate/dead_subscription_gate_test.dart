///
/// **F25a is the catalogue's injection reached through a lever; F25b is
/// ROADMAP criterion 3's wording — upstream stops updating while the link
/// stays up — reached through the product; and the row is only honest with

/// entirely from Phase 8 machinery (08-05's freshness sweep degrading to
/// `badStale`, 08-09's `PIPE.upstream.<alias>.data_age_ms`), because the
/// failure that actually happens in a fish factory is a PLC that stops
/// answering while its TCP connection stays perfectly healthy, and that one
/// the shipped gateway *can* see. Post-CR-02 the stored gauge is pushed only
/// on link events and arrivals, and `judge()` re-derives the age
/// synchronously on the READ path (`pipe_health.dart:210-216`) — so the
/// climb is observed by **repeated reads inside `until()` windows**, never
