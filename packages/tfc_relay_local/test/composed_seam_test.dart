/// **The composition that ships, assembled.** Server, policy decorator, a
/// PREFIXING resolver, and the real [TimescaleReader] behind a real
/// `LocalStateMan`, over a real socket.
///
/// ## Why this file exists
///
/// 10-REVIEW's answer to question 1 counted five contract legs and found that
/// exactly one composition had never been assembled by anything — and that it
/// was the only one that ships:
///
/// | Leg | Source under the checks | Resolver | Policy |
/// |---|---|---|---|
/// | `fake_contract_test.dart` | `FakeStateMan` | — | no |
/// | `channel_full_contract_test.dart` | `FakeStateMan` | — | no |
/// | `tfc_relay_server/test/ws_contract_test.dart` | `FakeStateMan` | identity | yes |
/// | `tfc_relay_client/test/contract/ws_contract_test.dart` | `FakeStateMan` | identity | yes |
/// | `contract_db_test.dart` | **real reader/store** | prefixing | **no** |
///
/// Every leg with the policy uses a resolver that answers `table == series`,
/// which makes a *double* resolution idempotent and therefore invisible; the
/// one non-identity resolver in the suite runs in the leg with no policy. CR-01
/// lived in that hole for the whole phase: `_PolicyTimeseries` resolved the
/// wire name into a **physical table** and handed that down, and
/// `TimescaleReader` parsed its argument as a **wire name** and resolved it
/// again. Against the deployed `gw_` prefix the second lookup missed and every
/// timeseries request over the pipe answered `UnknownSeries`, naming a table
/// the caller never sent.
///
/// So the subject here is not a method. It is the **seam**: what one layer
/// hands the next, measured through the whole stack rather than at either end.
/// [OneSeries] is what makes it visible — the fixture resolver whose table is
/// `gw_Line1.Motor1` while its series is `Line1.Motor1`, shared with
/// `timescale_reader_test.dart` so the two files cannot drift into judging
/// different mappings.
///
/// ## Why not a sixth contract leg
///
/// A sixth leg would need a TimescaleDB and would therefore live behind the
/// `db` tag, which is excluded from the default lane on three of the four CI
/// platforms — and CR-01 is not a property of Postgres. What the defect needs
/// is the *hand-off*, and [RecordingBackend] shows the hand-off exactly: the
/// SQL the reader built, against the table it chose. The rows-come-back half is
/// `contract_db_test.dart`'s and stays there.
///
/// ## Why the socket
///
/// `DataHandlers._series` resolves the name a third time (10-REVIEW IN-03), and
/// `RelaySession` is what builds the `PolicyStateMan` a panel actually talks
/// through. Composing the decorator by hand would judge a second object built
/// the same way rather than the one that ships.
