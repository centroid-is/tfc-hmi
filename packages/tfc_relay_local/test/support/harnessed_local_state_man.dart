/// The test-only control surface `LocalStateMan` is judged through, and the
/// one-fake-link subject the fourth contract leg runs over.
///
/// ## The levers are here and never on the production class
///
/// `StateManHarness` is `setValue`, `setValues`, `setQuality`, `dropKey`,
/// `disconnectUpstream` and `reconnectUpstream` — six ways to make a value
/// appear or a link fall over. On a class a connected session can reach, those
/// six are an unauthenticated write path into every operator's screen
/// (T-08-42): `setValue('ST101.CN01.MOT01.speed', 0, quality: Quality.good)` is
/// a stopped conveyor that reads as running, minted by the gateway itself and
/// indistinguishable from a real sample. 08-RESEARCH and 08-PATTERNS both say
/// the levers live on a test-only type, and it is worth repeating here because
/// **the shortest path to green is to put them on `LocalStateMan` and it is the
/// wrong one** — the class is `final`, a wrapper is four dozen lines of
/// forwarding, and a member added to the real class would be one line. The
/// `freeze_test.dart` sweep added by 08-11 is what makes that shortcut fail
/// rather than merely be discouraged.
///
/// ## Why a wrapper and not a subclass
///
/// `LocalStateMan` is a `final class`. That is not an obstacle to work around;
/// it is the reason this file forwards every member by hand, which is the same
/// explicit-delegation rule `local_state_man.dart` follows and for the same
/// reason: a member added to `StateManApi` in a later phase becomes a compile
/// error here instead of silently arriving unpoliced through a
/// `noSuchMethod`.
///
/// ## ONE fake upstream link, and the conflict that forces it
///
/// Two freshness checks disagree about what `disconnectUpstream()` may do, and
/// both are right about the property they defend:
///
///  * `checkUpstreamLossDegradesAffectedKeys` calls it **once** and requires
///    *both* `ST101.CN01.MOT01.speed` and `ST201.CN04.MOT01.speed` to degrade
///    — a mimic with half its boxes greyed reads as a plant fault and sends
///    somebody to the wrong end of the building.
///  * `checkUpstreamLossAnnouncesOnce` calls the same lever and requires
///    **exactly one** announcement — Sparkplug sends one NDEATH for a whole
///    node because 1500 status events for one event is a denial of service
///    against the operator's own screen.
///
/// `StateManHarness.disconnectUpstream()` takes no alias. With the two fixture
/// keys on two real links, honouring SRV-08's per-alias degradation makes the
/// second check read two announcements and fail — for doing the right thing.
/// 08-CONTEXT ruling 8 settles it: **the contract leg runs over one fake
/// upstream link with a keymapping routing both fixture keys to that single
/// alias**, so the suite measures what it was written to measure. The
/// multi-link property is not thereby unjudged — `link_loss_test.dart` (08-09)
/// carries it, with a real per-alias degradation and a real per-alias
/// announcement. **Both. Neither substitutes for the other.**
///
/// ## The second link, and why it does not break ruling 8
///
/// There is a second `FakeUpstreamLink` here and it carries exactly one key:
/// the designated read-only one. It exists so
/// `checkReadOnlyKeyIsRejectedNotThrown` earns a **genuine** refusal —
/// `supportsWrites: false` on the link, which is what an M2400 weigher is by
/// protocol — rather than a staged outcome that would pass whatever the write
/// path did. It never disconnects: [StateManHarness.disconnectUpstream]
/// forwards to the plant link alone, so the announce-once arithmetic is
/// untouched and the "one fake upstream link" ruling 8 is about is the one
/// link the loss cases can see.
///
/// The M2400 is the natural device-level read-only and this leg models it with
/// a fake rather than with `M2400StubServer`, because a contract leg must not
/// depend on a stub server's port: fifty checks each standing a listener up is
/// fifty chances for a parallel worktree to lose a race that has nothing to do
/// with the property being judged.
///
/// ## The levers are synchronous, and the store is reached synchronously
///
/// 08-07 recorded that `UpstreamLinkDriver`'s levers are synchronous while the
/// link's own delivery is a broadcast stream, and left the fix to whoever first
/// needed it. This is that plan. The fix is small and it is here: each lever
/// forwards to the fake link **and** applies the same values through
/// `LocalStateMan.applyUpstreamBatch`, the production ingest seam `readMany`
/// already uses. Two reasons, and the first is not convenience:
///
///  1. The fake publishes into a per-key broadcast controller that only exists
///     once something has subscribed. A contract case that seeds fifty keys and
///     *then* listens would seed into nothing — `arrived()` would time out and
///     the failure would name a property nobody broke.
///  2. `StateManHarness.setValue` returns `void`. An async lever is not
///     available to be written, so "settle" has to happen inside the lever.
