/// A whole pipe in one setUp: N fake PLC links into a `LocalStateMan`, a real
/// `RelayServer` on an ephemeral port, and N real `RemoteStateMan` panels over

/// rather than assume.
///
/// **The shape is copied from `tfc_relay_client/test/support/gate_fixture.dart`
/// with its reasons restated, not imported** — no `package:` URI reaches
/// another package's `test/` directory, which is the same reason that file and
/// `fault_fixture.dart` are already copies of each other's ideas rather than
/// one import. Where this file diverges, the divergence is the point: gate A's
/// plant is a `FakeStateMan`; this plant is the real `LocalStateMan` composed
/// over per-alias `FakeUpstreamLink`s, because gate B's rows are about the
/// upstream boundary — a PLC reprogramming, a poisoned poll cycle — and a
/// fixture whose plant has no upstream has no boundary to poison.
///
/// **Teardown order, and why it is registered backwards** (gate A's argument,
/// `gate_fixture.dart:18-36`, restated). `addTearDown` runs
/// last-registered-first, so registrations read backwards from execution:
/// plant, then proxies, then the gateway, then every panel — executing as
/// **all panels, then the gateway, then the proxies, then the plant (which
/// owns and disposes the links)**. The panel goes first because it is the only
/// participant that *reconnects*: a gateway closed under a live panel leaves
/// that panel dialling a dead port for the rest of the run, and the attempts
/// land as noise on whichever case is unlucky enough to be running then. The
/// proxies cannot go first because shutting one down destroys both halves of
/// every pair it carries. The plant goes last because its freshness sweep and
/// its links must outlive anything still draining through them —
/// `LocalStateMan.dispose` disposes the links itself
/// (`local_state_man.dart:386-388`), so the links need no registration of
/// their own and giving them one would only be a second lifetime for the same
/// objects.
///
/// **The composition is `buildGateway`'s, restated.** `buildGateway` builds
/// its links from config and cannot take these fakes, so this file composes
/// the same three pieces in the same order — `LocalStateMan` under
/// `RelayServer` with `wireStatusNotifications` between them — that
/// `gateway_config.dart:573-617` composes, status wiring included, because a
/// pipe whose panels never hear a status notification is the exact
/// half-composition 08-13 deviation 1 records shipping once already.
///
/// **Port 0, always.** 08-03's ninth freeze: no literal port anywhere under
/// `test/`, so two worktrees can run this suite at once. The OS picks the
/// port; the panels dial what it picked.
