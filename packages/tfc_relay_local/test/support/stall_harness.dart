/// The gateway and its three upstreams in a second isolate, pausable and
/// resumable — F22's SIGSTOP, and the deliberate **inversion** of
/// `suspend_harness.dart`.
///
/// **The whole design in one sentence: whatever is being frozen cannot be the
/// thing doing the observing.** `suspend_harness.dart` (client package) and its
/// copy `panel_isolate.dart` (this package) freeze a *panel* and keep the
/// gateway in the test isolate; F22 needs the mirror. Here the `LocalStateMan`,
/// its three `FakeUpstreamLink`s, the `RelayServer` and a self-driving plant
/// all live in the isolate this object can pause, and the panels stay in the
/// test isolate. A panel that was paused would observe nothing, and F22's
/// subject is what *five never-frozen panels* see when the gateway stops
/// turning.
///
/// **This harness is F22-only and is deliberately not generalised, and it is
/// kept separate from `panel_isolate.dart` on purpose.** `suspend_harness.dart`
/// states the refusal (`:16-20`): a "freeze any participant remotely" helper
/// would be a second fixture with its own lifetime rules that the next reader
/// has to learn before reading one row. The two harnesses freeze opposite ends
/// of the same pipe — a panel there, the gateway here — and merging them would
/// put both lifetimes in one file and make each row's reader carry the other
/// row's machinery. So this is a third file that copies the *pattern* — the
/// bounded [StalledGateway.ask] failing by command name, the error port with an
/// up-budget, idempotent pause/resume, a graceful-then-kill shutdown, and a
/// `resume()` in `addTearDown` — and inverts what sits inside the isolate.
///
/// **Nothing is shared across the boundary.** Everything a case injects,
/// samples or asserts about the *gateway* crosses as a plain map through
/// [StalledGateway.ask]; everything the panels see is an ordinary in-process
/// read of a real `RemoteStateMan` the case built itself. A shared object would
/// have to survive being paused.
///
/// **The plant drives itself inside the isolate.** A `Timer.periodic` bumps
/// every key of every link on a period, so "values kept changing right up to
/// the freeze, and again after it" is true without a lever crossing the
/// boundary mid-pause. That timer is not on the freeze suite's allow-list and
/// needs no entry: `freeze_test.dart`'s `timerOffenders` sweep scans `lib/src`
/// only (`freeze_test.dart:143`, `:756-786`; `periodicTimerAllowList` names
/// `lib/src` files), and this file is under `test/support`, exactly as
/// `panel_isolate.dart:408`'s ticker already is with no entry.
///
/// **Port 0, always.** 08-03's ninth freeze: no literal port anywhere under
/// `test/`, so two worktrees can run this suite at once. `ServerConfig.port`
/// defaults to zero; the isolate reports the bound port back and the panels
/// dial what the OS picked.
///
/// **A capability probe is the file's first case** (`suspend_gate_test.dart:
/// 228`'s shape). The in-repo pause measurement (07-RESEARCH §A.4: 15 ticks in
/// 300 ms, 0 across 600 ms of pause) was taken on a *client* isolate with no
/// listening socket. Whether a paused isolate that *owns a listening socket*
/// stops accepting and reading — so panels' bytes queue in the kernel exactly
/// as under SIGSTOP — is assumption A3, and the probe in `stall_gate_test.dart`
/// turns it into a number on this platform.
