/// A real panel in a second isolate that engages a hold-to-run deadman, and
/// which this object can pause, kill abruptly, or shut down gracefully — F26's
/// three deaths of a held momentary control, spelled so they work on all three
/// platforms.
///
/// **The pattern is `tfc_relay_client/test/support/suspend_harness.dart`, not
/// the class.** This is a copy of that file's ideas and not an import: no
/// `package:` URI reaches another package's `test/` directory (the same reason
/// `gate_b_fixture.dart` copies `gate_fixture.dart` rather than importing it),
/// and the pieces carried across are exactly the ones its own doc names —
/// the report pushed on the paused side's *own* timer so absence is observed
/// rather than inferred; the bounded [PanelIsolate.ask] that fails naming the
/// command instead of hanging; the error port and the up-budget so a dying
/// isolate is a named failure and not a suite timeout; idempotent
/// pause/resume, a graceful-then-kill shutdown, and a `resume()` registered in
/// `addTearDown` so a case failing between pause and resume cannot leave a
/// paused isolate holding a socket the gateway is still writing to.
///
/// **What this harness adds over its source: a live hold.** `suspend_harness`
/// carries a panel that watches a value; this one carries a panel that *holds
/// a button*. The panel engages a hold-to-run deadman on a named key at
/// construction (through the shipped `HoldToRunController`, so the pulse
/// cadence and the release paths are the product's, not this file's) and feeds
/// the counter until it is paused, killed, or shut down. F26's whole subject
/// is what happens to that counter when the panel stops being there.
///
/// **The plant and the gateway stay in the test isolate; only the panel
/// moves** (`suspend_harness.dart:22-27`, restated). Everything a case injects
/// or asserts about the *plant* — above all the deadman counter on the plant
/// tag, read back off the fake link — is an ordinary in-process read. The only
/// thing that crosses the isolate boundary is what the panel itself can see,
/// and it crosses as plain maps: nothing is shared, because a shared object
/// would have to survive being paused. The row's observable is what the PLC
/// would see, so it is read from the plant side and never from the panel that
/// is about to die.
///
/// **Two channels, and the report is the instrument** (`suspend_harness.dart:
/// 29-38`, restated). [PanelIsolate.ask] is a bounded request/reply that fails
/// naming the command rather than hanging — a paused isolate cannot answer,
/// which is a stronger statement than "no reports arrived". The panel also
/// *pushes* a [PanelReport] on every one of its own periodic ticks: a paused
/// or killed isolate sends nothing, so its silence is measured on this side
/// rather than assumed.
