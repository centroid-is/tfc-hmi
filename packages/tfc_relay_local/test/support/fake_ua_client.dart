/// An in-memory `ua.ClientApi`, so the OPC UA adapter's **lifecycle** can be
/// judged without a server.
///
/// ## Why this exists when there is a real in-process server one file over
///
/// `opcua_link_test.dart` runs against a genuine open62541 `Server` and that
/// is the right subject for anything about the *wire*: what a Bad status
/// deserializes to, whether a monitored item is re-created after a reprogram,
/// what the binding does with a source timestamp. None of those can be faked
/// honestly.
///
/// The three lifetime hazards 08-REVIEW found are a different kind of
/// question, and the real server is the wrong instrument for all three:
///
///  * **WR-04** is *"`dispose()` landed while `connect()` was between two
///    awaits"*. Against a real server the window is microseconds wide and
///    cannot be aimed at; the failure it produces is a **SEGV**, which does
///    not fail a case, it kills the process running it. Here the window is a
///    lever ([connectDelay]).
///  * **WR-03** is *"the injected client was never deleted"*, and the symptom
///    is a worker isolate outliving the VM's last `await`. There is no isolate
///    census a case can read; there is a [deleteCount] here.
///  * **WR-05** is *"one deadline was spent five times"*, and what a case
///    needs there is a phase that is slower than its share. [connectDelay],
///    [subscriptionDelay] and [readDelay] supply that; the elapsed time is
///    then measured from outside, because `.timeout()` is applied by the
///    caller and a double cannot see what it was given.
///
/// So this double is deliberately not a second OPC UA implementation — it
/// answers nothing about the protocol, and every case that uses it is about
/// this package's own bookkeeping.
