/// <String>[]` (`resync_engine.dart:65`) — **uncapped, with no cap anywhere** —
/// and appended from six sites. What holds it down is a pair of per-tick
/// suppression maps Phase 7 added for the G1 fix
/// (`connection_supervisor.dart:251-252`), and **those maps are cleared on every

/// refused the rebuild it needs.
///
/// The gateway's own source names the scenario a chaos soak produces, at
/// `connection_supervisor.dart:692-702`:
///
/// > *"`ResyncEngine._recover` failing leaves the subscription unestablished on
/// > purpose and does not unsubscribe server-side, so the gateway keeps pushing
/// > `u` frames for the rest of the socket's life — every one of them with all
/// > its handles unknown, every one of them restarting the recovery that just
/// > failed, **each with another complaint on an unbounded list**."*
///
/// The only thing standing between that sentence and a flood is
/// `state.lastSeq != null`. A thirty-five-minute storm that flaps a link
/// hundreds of times, clearing the suppression maps every time, is the most
/// likely thing in this repository to find the hole in that guard. This checker
/// exists to catch it if it is there and to leave a measured number behind if it
/// is not.
///
/// # What a complaint actually is, measured — and the premise this corrects
///
/// 11-05's plan asserts *"`complaints.length > 0` at run end. A storm that
/// produced no complaints at all means the panels never lost a subscription,
/// which for a flap storm means the faults did not reach them."* **The first
/// step of that inference is false, and the lane measured it.** Five
/// ninety-second runs at seed 11 produced 2–8 readiness dips per storm-targeted
/// panel and **zero complaints in the whole herd, every run.**
///
/// The cause is in the append sites rather than in the storm. There are three,
/// all in `resync_engine.dart`, and every one of them needs a re-establishment
/// that went **wrong**:
///
/// - `:208` — inside `_recover`'s `catch`. The `subscribe` threw.
/// - `:249` — one per key the gateway returned in `SubscribeResult.rejected`
///   (`_classify`, `session_handlers.dart:303`: an empty key or one this source
///   does not serve).
/// - `:252` — `result.complaints`, whatever the gateway chose to say.
///
/// An ordinary flap — socket dies, backoff, reconnect, resubscribe succeeds —
/// appends **nothing**. That is the pipe working, and it is the common case.
/// So a run with zero complaints is not evidence of a broken soak; it is
/// evidence that every rebuild the storm forced actually rebuilt.
///
/// The anti-vacuity gate is therefore written against the condition that makes
/// the complaint path *reachable*, which is [SoakPanelLogView.reestablishments]
/// — see [BoundedLogsChecker.reestablishments] and
/// [boundedLogsExercisedFloor]. The complaint total is printed on every run and
/// asserted against zero on none.
///
/// # Why the verdict is a rate and not a total
///
/// A total over thirty-five minutes is either so loose it never fires or so
/// tight that a legitimately noisy storm burst trips it — and the two are the
/// same number seen from different runs, which is why nobody can pick it. The
/// primary verdict is therefore **complaints per minute per panel**, measured
/// over a sliding [boundedLogsRateWindow] and sampled at every checkpoint,
/// against [boundedLogsCeilingPerMinute]. The absolute total is a second,
/// **sustained** allowance ([boundedLogsTotalBackstopPerMinute]) for the one
/// thing a burst ceiling cannot see: a list that grows steadily, slowly and for
/// ever. It sits *below* the burst ceiling rather than above it, and the
/// constant says why.
///
/// Measured, under the sabotage the plan asked for: replacing the rate with an
/// absolute total made a genuine one-window burst — 30 complaints in 30 s, 60 a
/// minute — **stop being recorded at all**, while a slow drift to the same
/// total fired. The verdict had become a statement about how long the run was.
/// That pair of outcomes is the argument for a rate.
///
/// The ceiling is **derived and not chosen**, and the derivation had to change
/// shape because the measured p95 came back zero. Both anchors are on the
/// constant. `GATE_LANE_BUDGET`'s 480 s is the precedent for how a number like
/// this is declared and argued in this repository.
///
/// # Do not raise the gateway's log level to get better forensics
///
/// It changes what is being measured, and it would trip this ceiling itself.
/// `package:logger` at `trace` with `PrettyPrinter` is measured in this project
/// at seconds of lag per burst (PR #210), which is why
/// `relay_gateway.dart:44-46` says in so many words that *"a gateway logs
/// conditions, not events"* and pins `Level.info`. This is the file where
/// somebody would think of turning it up, so it says so here.
///
/// # The two halves, and both are real
///
/// **Client side** is [SoakPanelLogView.complaints], the uncapped list itself.
///
/// **Server side** is [SoakLogSource.gatewayLogLines] — and it is a genuine
/// log-line count rather than a stand-in. `buildGateway`'s default error sink is
/// `_logServerError(log)`, `(error, stack, where) => log.e('[server] $where:
/// $error')` at `gateway_config.dart:492-497`, installed at `:643`. The soak
/// occupies that same injectable seam with a collector
/// (`gate_b_fixture.dart:656`), so one collected entry is exactly one line the
/// deployed gateway would write. No subprocess harness was needed and no
/// deviation was taken: the `[MT-6]` re-read's stop condition — *"if the gateway
/// only writes to stdout"* — does not hold. `package:logger` and stdout appear
/// only in `bin/relay_gateway.dart`, which composes the seam this fixture
/// occupies, and which the soak does not run.
///
/// [SoakLogSource.plantIngestLogLines] is the second server-side surface and the
/// closest structural twin of the client damping this invariant's control
/// removes: `IngestLog` damps to **once per key per process** precisely because
/// *"a struct that fails at 10 Hz writes 864,000 identical lines a day"*
/// (`ingest.dart:96-101`).
///
/// # The shared observable
///
/// `complaints.length` is watched by invariant 4 as well, which asks whether the
/// list grows without bound where this one asks whether it grows too fast inside
/// a window. A genuine flood trips both, and that is correct — but the report
/// must not present it as two independent findings corroborating each other
/// (pitfall 8). `soak_test.dart`'s verdict block prints the
/// one-finding-two-instruments sentence when both record against this observable
/// in the same checkpoint.
