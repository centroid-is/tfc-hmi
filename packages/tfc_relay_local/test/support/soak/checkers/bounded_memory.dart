/// **What this checker does instead, and why that is stronger.** It reads the
/// eleven structures the clause is actually about, simultaneously, every five
/// seconds, and asserts two things about the *shape* of the series rather than
/// one thing about its maximum: a structure may not end the run far above its
/// own median ([boundedMemoryRatio]), and no structure may climb without pause
/// across [boundedMemoryMonotoneRun] consecutive checkpoints once it has
/// settled. Both are slope statements, and a slope is the only thing a leak
/// reliably is. §7.8 asks for *"heap high-water marks bounded"*, which is an
/// RSS reading wearing a different noun, and the paragraph above is this
/// repository refusing that reading with a measurement behind it. The departure
/// is declared: `soak_registry.dart`, deviation 2, 11-CONTEXT ruling 3.
///
/// **RSS is still recorded, exactly once, and nothing here reads it.** The
/// write is `soak_driver.dart`'s checkpoint map, at the same five-second cadence
/// as this checker's rows, so a human reading `metrics.jsonl` sees the
/// allocator's number sitting next to the structures — which is what it is good
/// for and the only thing it is good for. A reviewer can `grep -rn currentRss
/// packages/tfc_relay_local/test/` and find that one write and this paragraph,
/// with no `expect` anywhere near either; `soak_meta_test.dart` asserts exactly
/// that, in the structural-sweep idiom, so an RSS ceiling cannot be added
/// quietly by somebody who did not read this far.
///
/// **The 4.5 GB lesson is the motivation and deliberately not the bound.**
/// Phase 2 measured unbounded proxy sink buffering at 4.5 GB in four seconds.
/// The structural instrument catches that class *earlier and more precisely*
/// than RSS would, because the send buffer's depth crosses its ceiling long
/// before the allocator notices — and it catches the slow ones, which RSS on a
/// hosted runner never can.
///
/// # What this invariant CANNOT assert, said plainly
///
/// **Client-side egress boundedness is not assertable from inside the client.**
/// F20's descope is a measurement, not an opinion: *"`dart:io` offers no
/// egress-completion signal … 'bounded' cannot be asserted from inside the
/// client"*, and the number behind it is 700 KB pushed onto a 100 kbit/s link
/// returning in 5 ms with zero bytes received. So this checker asserts the
/// **server-side** buffer, which is observable — and even there the observable
/// is the shipping health verdict rather than the raw depth. See
/// [degradedPanelsStructure].
///
/// **The resync engine's `_inFlight` map is private and has no debug getter**
/// (`resync_engine.dart:235`). Reaching it would mean editing
/// `tfc_relay_client/lib`, which this plan measures and does not change. What
/// stands in its place is [staleSubscriptionsStructure], the set the same tick
/// path maintains and the client does expose. The substitution is recorded
/// rather than silent because the plan named `_inFlight` by hand.
///
/// A note for anyone tidying `resync_engine.dart` while here: the
/// `whenComplete(() => _inFlight.remove(sub.subId))` at `:231-233` is a **block
/// body on purpose**. As an arrow body it deadlocks, because `Map.remove`
/// returns the very future `whenComplete` is attached to. Do not simplify it,
/// and do not let a sabotage leave it simplified.
///
/// # The shared observable
///
/// [complaintsStructure] is watched here **and** by invariant 5, which asks a
/// different question of it: this checker asks whether the list grows without
/// bound, and `bounded_logs.dart` asks whether it grows too fast inside a
/// window. A genuine flood trips both, which is correct — and the run report
/// must not present that as two independent findings corroborating each other
/// (pitfall 8). `soak_test.dart`'s verdict block prints the one-finding-two-
/// instruments sentence when both record against this observable in the same
