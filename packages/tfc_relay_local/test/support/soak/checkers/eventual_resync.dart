/// Invariant 3 — after each generated stable window, every subscribed key on
/// every panel equals plant truth, on **value and quality**.
///
/// **The gift of a pure generator.** Because the whole schedule exists before
/// the clock starts, 11-02 computed every interval in which nothing is armed
/// and nothing arms for at least [minStableWindow]. Those are the windows in
/// which convergence is *required* rather than hoped for, and this checker is
/// told where they are instead of watching for quiet reactively. Reactive
/// detection would have been vacuous most runs — 11-02 measured it: without
/// injection only 13 of 20 seeds clear an eight-window floor and the best
/// window in any run is 25.5 s.
///
/// **Quality is compared and not only value**, and this is the decision that
/// makes the epoch path visible at all. A panel rendering the right number
/// under `badStale` is a panel that has stopped vouching for it; treating that
/// as a match would report the whole `epochChange` cause as convergence and
/// the taxonomy would be five arms wide. `SoakPlantTruth.quality` is always
/// good — the fake plant publishes nothing degraded — so any degradation a
/// panel renders was produced by the pipe, which is exactly what is worth
/// asking about.
///
/// **Two comparisons, because the fixture has two kinds of key.**
/// `GateBPlantDriver` sweeps every clean key to one monotonically increasing
/// integer every 250 ms, and a `PlantMutate` pins one key to a fixed value
/// republished every cycle thereafter. An overridden key is judged on equality
/// because its expected value stands still. A swept key is judged on **lag in
/// sweeps**, because a value that changes four times a second is never
/// instantaneously equal to anything: demanding equality would report the
/// wire's own transit time as a divergence, two hundred of them per sample, on
/// a healthy pipe. See [convergedLagSweeps] for the allowance and where it came
/// from.
///
/// **What this checker does NOT do is judge.** A mismatch is a divergence
/// *event* handed to the [DivergenceLedger] with an attributed cause, not a
/// violation. The only things it records as violations are the two failures
/// that are about the instrument rather than about the pipe: a run that
/// produced no qualifying windows, and the never-faulted control panel
/// diverging in a window the storm never disturbed.

  /// assumption A4 says so, and `soak_timeline.dart` says it at the constant.
  /// The derivation was: the per-subscription staleness limit is `tickMs x 30`
  /// and the ordinary tick is 50-100 ms, so 1.5-3 s covers detection and a
  /// resync round trip on a recovered link is sub-second, leaving better than
  /// 3x margin at ten seconds.
  ///
  /// **That derivation left out the reconnect backoff, and the backoff
  /// dominates.** What is printed here is the observed in-window convergence
  /// time — how long a key that was out of step at a window's start took to
  /// come back into step — and the lane run that first produced it measured
  /// **p50 9251 ms, p95 9498 ms against a 10,000 ms window**. A panel whose
  /// link the storm cut does not resync as soon as the fault clears: it waits
  /// out an exponential backoff with full jitter capped at thirty seconds
  /// (`ClientConfig`), and only then hellos, subscribes and takes a snapshot.
  /// So the quantity the window has to cover is *backoff plus resync*, not
  /// resync alone.

  /// **[marginNote] says what that means for this arm**, on every run, green
  /// or red, because the margin is the number that decides whether residue is
