/// Invariant 1 — **no value is rendered as fresh whose age exceeds its
/// deadline.**
///
/// **The claim is about the verdict, not about the age.** A checker that
/// asserted "no value was older than X" would measure a different and weaker
/// thing: values go legitimately old all the time — a blackholed link, a PLC
/// mid-download, a quiet window — and the pipe is *correct* while that happens
/// so long as it says so. What CLAUDE.md's Core Value forbids is the panel
/// showing a five-minute-old tank level as current. So this samples the
/// **verdict** first and only then checks the age behind it, and getting that
/// the right way round is the whole design.
///
/// **What "the panel reports it fresh" means here.** CLI-04's three states, all
/// three of which a widget renders and all three of which have to say *fresh*
/// before this checker treats the reading as a claim of currency:
///
///  * `RemoteStateMan.viewIsStale` — the link has gone a whole
///    `ClientConfig.freshnessDeadline` without a frame of any kind.
///  * `RemoteStateMan.isSubscriptionStale(page)` — this page's plant-side
///    source has stopped being re-evaluated. Live, computed on read, so a
///    saturated link delivering old frames cannot agree with itself for ever
///    (07-RESEARCH §B.4).
///  * the value's own `Quality` — the gateway's `FreshnessSweep` degrades a key
///    to `Quality.badStale` once it is past `staleAfter`.
///
/// Any one of them dissenting is the panel being honest about doubt, and is
/// counted in [staleSamples] rather than judged as a lie.
///
/// **The age is measured against the monotonic anchor at last-frame-arrival,
/// and there is no wall clock in this file.** That is 07-REVIEW CR-01's
/// standing lesson and this milestone has now caught it four times (Phase 8
/// CR-01/CR-02, Phase 9 WR-01, Phase 10 WR-02). [SoakClock] hands out monotonic
/// elapsed time and nothing else, so the arithmetic below cannot be stepped by
/// an NTP correction even by accident — `invariant.dart` made it unreachable
/// rather than forbidden, and freeze 9 sweeps the spelling out of the tree.
///
/// What counts as an arrival is a **change in the rendered triple** — value,
/// quality and source time. The soak's plant moves every key of every link
/// every 250 ms with a monotonically increasing number (`GateBPlantDriver`), so
/// every key genuinely changes on every sweep and "when did this panel last
/// hear about this key" is a question the render surface can answer without
/// reaching into the client.
///
/// **Health keys are excluded by prefix, never by a list.** [PipeKeys.isPipeKey]
/// — the same predicate 08-05 task 3 owns and proved with a key called
/// `PIPE.invented.later`. 06-SUMMARY records what an enumerated list costs:
/// applying freshness accounting to `PIPE.cert.days_to_expiry`, which changes
/// once a day, *"greys out the indicator permanently and precisely while
/// nothing is wrong."* A second spelling of the prefix is the drift 08-04's
/// freeze exists to prevent.
///
/// **The 25 ms cadence is inherited, not chosen.**
/// `flap_gate_test.dart:55-160`: *"a sampler that took one reading per up-window
/// could miss the flicker the row is named for"*. A one-second flap half is the
/// fastest thing this storm produces. The cost is stated rather than hidden:
/// five panels x their subscribed keys x forty samples a second is the soak's
/// dominant per-tick expense, and it is the reason the herd default is 5 rather
/// than gate A's 20 (11-RESEARCH A6). If a run shows the sampler is cheap,
/// raising the population is a later decision with a measurement behind it.
