/// The composed pipe under the storm: one real gateway, N real panels behind N
/// real fault proxies, the merged timeline played on one clock, and the
/// population floor underneath all of it.
///
/// **The driver is a player, not an author.** Every random draw in this phase
/// happened at generation time, in `soak_event.dart`, from
/// `SeededScenarioRandom`. Which key a panel subscribes, which value it writes,
/// which panel writes, which alias goes down — all of it arrives here as a
/// `SoakEvent` arm and none of it is decided here. That is what makes a repro
/// log a reproduction rather than a summary, and it is why this file contains
/// no draw at all: `Random(` and `DateTime.now()` are both swept out of the
/// soak trees by freeze 9.
///
/// **What it composes is what ships.** Phase 10's CR-01 is the standing lesson:
/// its timeseries family was dead in the shipping gateway because the one
/// composition that ships — server plus policy plus real store — had never been
/// assembled by any test, while every fake made the bug idempotent and
/// invisible. *Capability flags prove a leg ran; parity proves the legs agree;
/// neither proves the stack a panel talks to was ever assembled.* So this
/// driver stands up the real `RelayServer` building its own session policy
/// through `RelaySession`, real listening sockets, real `RemoteStateMan`
/// panels over real TCP, and the real `LocalStateMan` over per-alias
/// `FakeUpstreamLink`s. The only fake in the picture is the PLC, which is the
/// one participant CI cannot have.
///
/// It composes [gateBFixture] rather than standing a second herd up beside it.
/// That fixture already assembles those five pieces in `buildGateway`'s own
/// order, in this package, with the teardown argument written out — a parallel
/// herd would be a second answer to a question that has one.
///
/// **Panel 0 is the control, and the exclusion is this file's job.** The
/// generator cannot tell a control panel from an ordinary one
/// (`soak_event.dart`'s contract: *"`panels` is the set the storm may target,
/// and the caller excludes the control by not passing it in"*). So [SoakDriver]
/// never passes the control's name to [buildTimeline], never gives its proxy to
/// the link half, and refuses to start against any timeline that names it —
/// see [SoakDriver.start]. The argument for having a control at all is
/// `long_outage_gate_test.dart`'s, applied to a herd: *"the server released the
/// dead session" is only worth saying if the server did not also release live
/// ones — which is exactly what it did on the build before 07-08b, once every
/// six seconds, to every panel in the plant.* An all-faulted population cannot
/// see that class of regression; one healthy panel makes it glaring.
///
/// **One clock, one chained timer, and why there is no second playback.** The
/// merged timeline is a **total** order — 11-02 sorted it on
/// `(offset, streamIndex, indexWithinStream)` precisely so that two entries at
/// one offset have a defined relative order that the length of the list cannot
/// change. Playing it means playing it *in that order*, from one clock. Running
/// the link half through per-proxy `ScenarioPlayback` instances would give each
/// its own `Stopwatch` and discard the very ordering the merge exists to fix,
/// so [SoakDriver] walks `merged` itself with one chained timer off one
/// `Stopwatch` — `ScenarioPlayback`'s own shape and its own reasons (a lever
/// that takes a moment to apply does not push every later offset out; there is
/// only ever one pending timer, so "no timer fires after stop" is a property of
/// the shape) — and pulls the link levers through
/// [ScenarioPlayback.apply], which is the existing exhaustive switch over
/// `FaultMutation` and is not restated here.
///
/// **A lever that fired into nothing is a first-class outcome.** Every arm of
/// [SoakDriver.apply] returns a [SoakApplyOutcome] naming the lever it pulled
/// and saying whether it did anything. A storm that quietly narrows itself —
/// a second `disconnectUpstream` on an alias already down returns early
/// (`fake_upstream_link.dart:397`), an unsubscribe from a panel holding no
/// subscription — is the failure mode both halves of the artifact hide on their
/// own: `repro.log` says it was planned and `events.jsonl` says it was applied,
/// and neither says it did nothing.
