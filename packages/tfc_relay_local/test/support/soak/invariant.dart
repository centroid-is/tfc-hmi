/// The contract every soak checker implements, and the two counters that make
/// anti-vacuity structural instead of argumentative.
///
/// **The problem this file exists to solve.** An assertion that did not run
/// and an assertion that passed look identical in a run report — that is
/// `gate_manifest_test.dart`'s skip audit in one sentence, and for a
/// thirty-five-minute unattended soak it is the dominant risk rather than one
/// risk among several. A checker whose observable never became available (no
/// subscription established, no write in flight, no stable window generated)
/// reports success for half an hour, at the end of which the run is green and
/// nothing was measured. Nobody reads the sample counts of a green run, so the
/// counts have to be asserted.
///
/// **The shape.** Every checker carries [InvariantChecker.judgedSamples] — how
/// many readings it could *judge*, not how many times it was called — and
/// [InvariantChecker.minimumSamplesForAVerdict], the floor below which its
/// verdict is not evidence. [assertNoVacuousVerdict] applies one gate to all
/// five, which is the whole reason the counters are on the interface rather
/// than being five arguments passed into five different assertions.
///
/// **This file is the contract and holds no checker.** 11-04, 11-05 and 11-06
/// implement against it, and a file that grows a checker is a file two plans
/// edit at once.
///
/// **There is no wall clock here, and that is structural.** [SoakClock] hands
/// a checker monotonic elapsed time and the run's declared duration and
/// nothing else, so a checker cannot age a verdict on the panel's RTC even by
/// accident — 07-REVIEW CR-01's standing lesson, made unreachable rather than
/// forbidden. A structural sweep in `soak_manifest_test.dart` asserts that the
/// word does not appear in this file at all. The journal takes its own wall
/// reading, because the journal is output.
