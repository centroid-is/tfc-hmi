/// The two halves of the storm, merged by a **total** order, with the quiet
/// windows the resync invariant needs designed in rather than hoped for.
///
/// **Why the third sort key exists.** `List.sort` is not stable in Dart: for
/// anything past a short list it is a dual-pivot quicksort, and two entries
/// the comparator calls equal can come out in either order depending on how
/// many other entries there are. Sorting the merged timeline on offset alone
/// therefore makes the relative order of two entries at one offset depend on
/// the *length* of the list — so adding a fifteenth event kind, or one more
/// link fault, could silently reorder a pair somewhere else in a storm whose
/// repro log is already pasted into an issue. [mergeTotalOrder] sorts on
/// `(offset, streamIndex, indexWithinStream)`, which is unique for every
/// entry, so there are no ties to break and the length cannot matter.
///
/// **Why the quiet windows are injected rather than waited for.** Invariant 3
/// — *after each stable window of at least [minStableWindow], every subscribed
/// key equals plant truth* — needs intervals in which nothing is armed. §7.8's
/// own link cadence is 1–10 s, so such intervals occur by luck and cannot be
/// counted on. 11-RESEARCH §C.3 lists three ways out and this file takes the
/// third:
///
///  * **(a) widen the link gap band to 1–15 s.** Makes quiet *more likely*,
///    changes §7.8's own specified cadence, and needs a declared deviation for
///    a property that is still emergent afterwards.
///  * **(b) weight `clean` up in the soak profile.** Same objection: more
///    likely, never guaranteed, and it changes the storm's character in a way
///    that is hard to reason about — a profile biased toward clearing is a
///    calmer storm everywhere, not just where the calm is needed.
///  * **(c) inject explicit quiet windows.** Taken. The windows are
///    *computed*, at generation time, from the duration alone; the event
///    generator draws around them and the merged timeline carries an explicit
///    clear for every incumbent at each window's start. §7.8's 1–10 s cadence
///    is untouched, so the link half needs no deviation at all, and "the
///    resync invariant had eight windows to judge" becomes a fact about the
///    seed rather than a fact about the run.
///
/// Naming (a) and (b) is the point: the next person reading this will have the
/// same three ideas, and two of them are worse for reasons that are not
/// obvious until they are written down.
///
/// **The link half is never regenerated.** [SoakTimeline.link] is exactly what
/// `ScenarioSchedule.generate(seed: seed, duration: d)` returns for that seed,
/// with its defaults, so `schedule_test.dart` still describes it and a link
/// repro log printed by any other phase still means what it said. What the
/// storm actually *plays* is [SoakTimeline.merged], which withholds the link
/// entries that fall inside a quiet window — see [buildTimeline].
///
/// **`ScenarioWeights.soak` is the default and it excludes `killOnce`.** That
/// matters twice. Pitfall 7's tail bias — a storm that drew `killOnce` skips
/// every later `cutMidFrame` and `reject`, because the proxy has no lever that
/// disarms it — cannot apply to this profile. And none of the profile's five
/// names exclude each other (`scenario_schedule.dart:356-359`), so the
/// exclusion table is never consulted for a default soak at all. Widening to
/// `ScenarioWeights.everything` would bring both back; do not do it without
/// reading this paragraph and `scenario_schedule.dart:462-470`.
