/// The eleven history-view methods against a **real TimescaleDB** — the second
/// `db`-tagged leg.
///
/// 8b's `db` lane, not a third one: the same tag, the same env-addressed
/// fixture, the same CI step, exactly as `timeseries_read_test.dart` joined it.
///
/// ## Why these cases need a real server and cannot be faked
///
/// Every one of the four mismatches this file exists to pin is a property of
/// what the *database* does with a value, not of what the store does with a
/// row:
///
///  * a `DateTime` written as `timestamp with time zone` and read back — the
///    microseconds and the `isUtc` flag are the database driver's answer, and
///    a fake would answer whatever the fake's author expected;
///  * `ON DELETE CASCADE` on three foreign keys, which is why upstream's
///    four-statement delete has not yet left a half-deleted view behind;
///  * `timescaledb_information.jobs`, which only exists where TimescaleDB does
///    and is the whole subject of the retention horizon;
///  * a `text` column that is NULL versus one holding the empty string, which
///    is a distinction only the server can be asked about.
///
/// ## Cleanup, and why it is by id rather than by table
///
/// The timeseries leg gives every *table* a per-run suffix. It cannot be done
/// here: the four history tables are named by drift's schema, shared with the
/// application's own HMI and with any 8b case that runs against the same
/// server. So every view this file creates is remembered and deleted in
/// `tearDownAll`, and the delete cascades to its keys, graphs and periods.
/// Nothing here touches a row it did not write.
