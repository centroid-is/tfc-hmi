/// A successful write must never blank the tag it just wrote.
///
/// **08-REVIEW CR-01, and it was reachable from the shipped gateway on every
/// write.** Both real adapters answer a successful write with
/// `WriteAcknowledged(at: …)` and **no readback** — the OPC UA one at
/// `opcua_upstream_link.dart:630`, the Modbus/UMAS base at
/// `modbus_upstream_link.dart:386` — because neither protocol hands a value
/// back with its acknowledgement. `translateWriteAnswer` maps that to
/// `WriteApplied(readback: null)`, and `_confirmWrite` used to put
/// `outcome.readback` into the store under `Quality.good`. So every successful
/// write from the shipped gateway published **null under a good quality** on
/// the key the operator had just written, until the next upstream sample
/// repainted it.
///
/// On a boolean indicator `asBool` on null reads false; on a numeric mimic it
/// is an empty box carrying no fault badge, so nothing tells the operator that
/// the reading is not a reading. That is the failure `_refuse`, `ingestSamples`
/// and `PipeHealth` each spend a paragraph refusing to commit — *"never a zero
/// and never a false"* — arriving by the one path nothing checked, because
/// **every arm in `write_test.dart` supplies a readback** and no real adapter
/// can.
///
/// ## The subject is a real adapter, deliberately
///
/// `FakeUpstreamLink.write` echoes the written value back as its readback, so
/// it cannot reach this defect and a case written against it would prove
/// nothing. The subject here is `DrivableModbusLink` — the production
/// `ModbusUpstreamLink` over a `DeviceClient` double — which produces exactly
/// the readback-less acknowledgement the plant produces.
///
/// ## The ruling this file pins
///
/// *Applied means applied **and read back**.* An acknowledgement with no value
/// in it confirms the write and not a reading, so the composer performs **one
/// bounded read** through the link and adopts what the device answers. A read
/// is not a retry: it asks the plant what it holds, and asking is the only way
/// this system is allowed to be sure. If that read does not produce a reading
/// either, the outcome stays `WriteApplied` and the **store is left alone** —
/// the subscription stream stays the truth, and the badge comes off so no
/// permanent amber box is left behind. Never a synthetic value, never null
/// under good.
