/// The `PIPE.upstream.<alias>.*` producer: HLTH-01's and HLTH-02's per-PLC half.
///
/// Every PLC's condition is an ordinary subscribable tag — same store, same
/// quality codes, same widgets as a temperature. *"There is no health method"*
/// is a recorded decision (design §4.7), so these keys are the health API, and
/// they have to behave like keys or a client has no way at all to ask whether a
/// PLC is alive.
///
/// Four properties, and each one is a way an indicator lies:
///
///  1. **Seeded before anything can subscribe.** A health indicator that reads
///     "unknown" until the first fault tells an operator nothing at the moment
///     they most need telling (`fake_state_man.dart:616-622`).
///  2. **Honest about what it does not know.** A reading the gateway cannot
///     produce is null under `errorConfig` — never `0`, never `false`.
///     `cert_health_state_man.dart:115-126`: a zero reads as a real
///     measurement and fires the alarm for a misspelled path, and the next real
///     warning is the one everybody ignores. `connected: false` on a link
///     nobody has asked about yet is the same lie wearing a bit instead of a
///     number.
///  3. **Carrying nothing an operator should not see.** `last_error` is fanned
///     out to every panel in the plant; an endpoint, a username or a
///     certificate path in it is information disclosure with the gateway's own
///     authority behind it (T-08-33).
///  4. **Excluded from their own freshness accounting** (HLTH-02). Every key
///     here changes only on an event, so freshness accounting would grey the
///     lot of them out permanently and precisely while nothing is wrong.
///
/// A note recorded rather than built: `@conn/<alias>/<field>`
/// (`conn_meta.dart:30-64`) is the app's shipped equivalent, with an almost
/// identical field catalogue — `reconnectCount` is `birth_count` under another
/// name and `uptimeSec` is `last_death_at` inverted. 08-CONTEXT ruling 4 says
/// the gateway serves the reserved namespace only, with an alias layer
/// available later if page churn proves painful.
