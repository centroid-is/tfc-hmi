/// Status of an audit log entry.
enum AuditStatus { pending, success, failed, declined }

/// The value written to `operator_id` on an audit row raised by an MCP tool
/// call.
///
/// **This column is provenance, not attribution.** It records that a machine
/// ran a tool; it is not a claim that a person authorized one, and it never
/// was. MCP cannot write — every write-shaped tool in this package returns a
/// *proposal* (`lib/src/tools/access_template_tools.dart:28`: "they return a
/// proposal"), so at the moment this row is written there is no person to
/// name. The human's name lands on the **approval** row instead:
/// `lib/core/access_template_store.dart:609` — an accepted proposal's row
/// "still names the human who approved it rather than the agent that suggested
/// it".
///
/// The value is the same provenance token the rest of the system already uses
/// for machine-originated changes: it is what the HMI's access-audit trail
/// maps to `MCP` for its **origin** column (`auditOriginLabel`,
/// `lib/widgets/audit_trail_row.dart:208`). Note what that sentence does and
/// does not say. That is a different column in a different database from this
/// one, and `audit_trail_row.dart`'s own doc records that the origin is
/// *planned* and nothing writes it yet. The token is shared; the field is not.
/// Nothing renders this table — there is no UI reader of the MCP server's
/// `AuditLog` anywhere in the app — so no display gaps either way.
///
/// It is a constant rather than a literal at the call site so the assertions
/// that pin it cannot drift from the value actually written, and so that the
/// root suite can name it across the package boundary through the barrel.
///
/// Do not read the absence of an operator name here as something lost. There
/// is exactly one kind of identity in this system, the access session's
/// signed-in user, and it is asserted where a change is applied. Inventing a
/// second mechanism to fill this column is the thing that was deliberately
/// removed.

/// after completion. This ensures that if a tool handler crashes, the pending

///
/// Accepts [McpDatabase] (not ServerDatabase) so it works with both
