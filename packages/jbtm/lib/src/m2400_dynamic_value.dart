///   (e.g., 'weight', 'unit', 'siWeight', 'field6')
/// - One child per unknown field, keyed by numeric ID string (e.g., '99')
/// - 'receivedAt' child with an **int**: microseconds since the Unix epoch
/// - 'deviceTimestamp' child with an **int**: microseconds since the Unix
///   epoch (only if non-null)
///
/// Both timestamps were ISO 8601 strings until #99 ("perf: reduce CPU usage
/// across paint pipeline"), which switched them to ints to cut string
/// allocation on the hot acquisition path. The doc here said "ISO 8601
/// string" for five months after that; if you are reading rows written before
/// #99 out of the collector's `jsonb` value column, expect strings there and
/// ints after.
///
/// Note the two are not equally well defined. [M2400ParsedRecord.receivedAt]
/// comes from `DateTime.timestamp()` and is UTC, so its epoch value is
/// unambiguous. [M2400ParsedRecord.deviceTimestamp] is recombined by
/// `extractTimestamp` from the device's date/time fields, which carry no zone,
/// so it is a **local** `DateTime` — converting it to epoch microseconds bakes
/// in the *host's* UTC offset. That is correct on the SVN stations (Iceland is
/// UTC+0 year round, no DST) and would shift on a host in another zone.
///
/// Status fields ([M2400Field.status], [M2400Field.weighingStatus]) have
/// their [DynamicValue.enumFields] populated with [WeigherStatus] entries.
