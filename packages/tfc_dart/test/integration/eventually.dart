/// Polls [probe] until its result satisfies [matcher], and returns that result.
///
/// These tests talk to a real Postgres through a write buffer and a retry
/// queue, so "the insert call returned" is a long way from "the row is
/// queryable". That gap is a millisecond on an idle laptop and can be seconds
/// on a loaded CI runner — which is exactly the shape that produces a test
/// passing here and failing there, one row short, twice a week.
///
/// The failing tests all shared one habit: sleep a fixed 50-200 ms, then
/// assert as if the sleep were a guarantee. It never was; it was a bet on the
/// runner being quick, and the bet is lost often enough to have trained
/// everyone to re-run CI instead of reading it. This waits for the condition
/// instead of guessing at a duration, so the fast path stays fast (it returns
/// on the first successful poll) and the slow path waits as long as it has to.
///
/// On timeout it fails with the **last observed value**, not just "timed out":
/// a flake that has become a real bug should say what it saw.
