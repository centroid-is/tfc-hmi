/// ## Why it wraps `Preferences` and not `PreferencesApi`
///
/// Spec §6 names `PreferencesApi`, but `preferencesProvider` returns a
/// `Preferences` and callers use members `PreferencesApi` does not have:
/// `setString(key, value, secret: true)` at `chat_widget.dart:361`,
/// `StateManConfig.toPrefs` writing with `secret: true, saveToDb: false`,
/// `onPreferencesChanged` driving the key-mappings watcher at
/// `state_man.dart:52`, and `isKeyInDatabase` in the preferences editor. A
/// decorator typed to the narrower interface would force every one of those
/// callers to change, which is exactly what "callers change nothing" forbids.
/// `Preferences` is a superset of `PreferencesApi`, so the spec's stated
/// contract holds too — `guarded_preferences_test.dart` asserts it.
///
/// ## Why reads are not gated
///
/// Spec §11 defers read permissions. A guarded read would break a station with
/// no session, which is every station at boot. Reads produce no audit row and
/// cannot be denied, for any key, at any session.
///
/// ## Why this surface fails closed
///
/// [AccessPolicy.groupForPref] is non-nullable and answers
/// [AccessGroup.administer] for anything it does not recognise. That is the
/// opposite of the tag surface, and the asymmetry is deliberate: a wrongly-open
/// setpoint is a nuisance, a wrongly-open config write is a broken plant
/// (spec §7).
///
/// ## The `database` escape, stated rather than hidden
///
/// `implements Preferences` obliges this class to expose a [database] getter,
/// so anything holding a `GuardedPreferences` can reach `prefs.database!.db`
/// and issue raw Drift that no guard sees. That is a real hole and it is not
/// closed here — see the getter. Section 3 of plan 03-03's write-path sweep is
/// what finds such a call site the first time it appears.

/// - `packages/tfc_dart/lib/core/state_man.dart:443` — `StateManConfig`'s
///   default, written with `secret: true, saveToDb: false`. It takes a
///   `Preferences`, which is why this object is typed `Preferences` and not
///   `PreferencesApi`.
/// - `lib/page_creator/page.dart:247`, reached from
///   `lib/providers/page_manager.dart:29` — the default page layout. This one
///   is **unawaited**, so a denial there surfaces as an unhandled asynchronous
///   error: the station shows the hardcoded layout, never persists it, and
///   prompts whoever is standing there on every cold boot.
/// - `packages/tfc_dart/lib/core/alarm.dart:220`, reached from
///   `lib/providers/alarm.dart:13` — the default `alarm_man_config`.
/// - `lib/providers/collector.dart:27` — the default `collector_config`.
/// - `lib/providers/mcp_bridge.dart:112` — the MCP config migration's removes.
///
/// Plan 03-06 owns that list, routes each site through here and caps the set
/// with a test. It has already grown once, from three to six. **Anything else
/// using this is a defect**, not a shortcut.
///
/// ## Why a named object and not a flag
///
/// The alternative was to make those paths fail open by key pattern. That would
/// put permanently unguarded keys in the policy table, and the next person
/// adding a boot default would add another without anyone noticing. A named
/// object with counted call sites is the version that stays visible.
///
/// ## Why it still writes a row
///
/// Spec §2: `origin` defaults to hand-made on purpose, so an unmarked machine
/// caller lands *in* the trail loudly rather than escaping it silently — an
/// absent audit row is the one defect nobody ever notices. Every write through
/// here is recorded with `origin: 'system'`, `allowed: true` and the group that
/// would have been required.
///
/// ## Residual risk
///
/// Anything holding a `GuardedPreferences` can reach
/// [GuardedPreferences.systemWrites] and write any configuration key without a
/// check. The controls are plan 03-06's call-site test and the fact that this
/// is a named member somebody has to type on purpose. Phase 4 can narrow it
/// further by moving the boot defaults behind a first-run path. Nothing here
