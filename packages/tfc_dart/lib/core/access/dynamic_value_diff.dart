/// One whole-struct write reduced to the members that actually changed.
///
/// Several assets are copy-on-write: clone the struct, set one field, write the
/// whole thing back (`conveyor.dart:2383`, `sensor.dart:778`,
/// `recipes.dart:454`). At the `StateMan` boundary that is a single write of a
/// single large value, so the audit trail either deduces which members moved or
/// it stores two blobs side by side and nobody ever filters it. Spec §2 asks
/// for `p_cmd_JogFwd false -> true`, and this file is the only place that
/// reduction happens.
///
/// ## Why this compares `.value` and never the wrappers
///
/// `DynamicValue` defines no equality of its own. The single equality operator
/// in `open62541-1.5.7+2/lib/src/dynamic_value.dart` is at line 23, on
/// `LocalizedText` — the helper, not the value. So for any two distinct
/// instances `a != b` is true, and it stays true when both hold `false`.
/// A diff written against the wrappers therefore marks *every* member changed
/// on *every* write, and a trail that reports thirty changes for a jog is one
/// nobody reads: it looks complete, which is worse than looking empty. The
/// reduction here recurses to the scalar leaves and compares the underlying
/// `.value`. `dynamic_value_diff_test.dart` builds both sides from separate
/// real `DynamicValue` instances so that a regression to wrapper comparison
/// fails rather than passes.
///
/// ## Why it is stateless
///
/// Both sides arrive as arguments. Spec §2's no-op suppression across
/// successive writes belongs at the guard, where the previous value lives;
/// there is no cache, no clock and no logger here, and pulse collapsing is
/// explicitly not built.
