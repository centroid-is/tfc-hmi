/// The bodies of `read`, `readFresh`, `readMany`, `write`, `writeStatus` and
/// the hold-to-run tick.
///
/// Same rule as `session_handlers.dart`, for the same reason: **nothing in
/// here registers anything.** Handlers are handed to `RelaySession._on`, which
/// is the one seam where a method enters the table and therefore the one place
/// the handshake gate and the error armor are applied. A handler that
/// registered itself would be a handler that arrived ungated, and `write`
/// ungated is a client that never said hello reaching a contactor.
/// A grep for the peer's registration call over this file is meant to come
/// back empty — and unlike `session_handlers.dart`, this doc does not spell
/// that call out, so the grep is a check anyone can run rather than a sentence
/// that answers itself.
///
/// ## Why these five exist in Phase 4 rather than Phase 5
///
/// 04-RESEARCH Finding 4 ran the method sweep against a live `RelayServer`:
/// every one of these answered `-32601 Unknown method`, which put 28 of the
/// contract suite's 44 checks out of reach over the real gateway. The
/// contract leg cannot run against a socket that cannot read or write, so the
/// plumbing was pulled forward. Only the plumbing.
///
/// ## What Phase 5 still owns, and this file deliberately does not do
///
///  * **Write semantics.** Three-state depth beyond forwarding what the source
///    reports, dedup of a re-sent `cmd` against a live window, hold-to-run and
///    the rest of the write-safety machinery (WRT-*).
///  * **Authorization.** Which keys a session may read and which it may
///    actuate is Phase 6 (SEC-03, T-04-03). Every method here is reachable by
///    anyone who completes the handshake. That is not an oversight being
///    hidden — it is the same posture `subscribe` has had since Phase 3, and
///    it attaches at the same per-key seam.
///
/// ## The outcome log, and the one answer it must never invent
///
/// `writeStatus` is answered from [WriteOutcomeLog] — a short-TTL map of
/// `cmd` → outcome, pruned on access rather than by a timer, and owned by the
/// **server** rather than by this per-session object. That lifetime is
/// 04-REVIEW CR-02 and the whole of why the log is a class of its own; its
/// library doc carries the argument.
///
/// [WriteNotReceived] is the only outcome that tells an operator a re-send is
/// safe. A gateway that has merely *forgotten* a command must therefore never
/// spell its amnesia that way — so absence from the log is not enough to say
/// "never received". Three pieces of evidence are required, all of them the
/// gateway's own: the `cmd` is a ULID and can be dated, the instant it names
/// is one this log was already recording at, and it is inside the TTL.
/// Anything else is [WriteUnknown], because the gateway cannot tell "never
/// arrived" from "arrived while I was not looking".
