/// One session's view of the shared source, with the policy already applied.
///
/// **Source: 06-RESEARCH §E.2**, and orchestrator ruling OQ1 approving the
/// shape. Four placements were considered and three rejected: per-call-site
/// checks inside the handlers (six sites today, six *files* by Phase 10, and
/// the one somebody forgets is the unauthorized surface), `ServedStateMan` (a
/// test-kit peer, not production) and `LocalStateMan` (does not exist yet, and
/// is one instance shared by every panel while policy is per identity).
///
/// What is left is a decorator, and the argument for it is the one
/// `relay_session.dart:484-489` already makes about the handshake gate: the
/// check belongs at the seam every request comes through, because "a
/// per-handler check would be a rule every future plan has to remember, and
/// the one it forgot would be the method that serves plant data to a client
/// that never authenticated". `RelaySession` hands this object — never the
/// source it wraps — to both `SessionHandlers` and `ValueHandlers`, so a
/// handler added in Phase 10 cannot reach around the policy, because there is
/// no unwrapped source in scope to reach for (T-06-38).
///
/// ## What breaks in the plant without this file
///
/// Nothing today, and that is the honest answer: the shipped policy is
/// all-visible and `operate`-writes, so this object is transparent and the
/// whole suite is unchanged by it. What breaks is *later*. The first
/// deployment that needs one station not to see one tag would otherwise get
/// six hand-written checks across five files, and the hiding rule — hidden is
/// indistinguishable from nonexistent — cannot survive being spelled six
/// times. It survives being spelled once, in [keys].
///
/// ## `keys` is the hiding primitive
///
/// This is the whole design and it is worth stating plainly. Every surface
/// that can reveal a tag's existence already gates on `keys`:
///
///  * `value_handlers.dart:212` — `read`'s `api.keys.contains`.
///  * `value_handlers.dart:244` — `readFresh`'s, added by 06-04.
///  * `value_handlers.dart:276` — `readMany`'s `servable` set.
///  * `value_handlers.dart:387` — `write`'s, and with it `holdToRun`, which
///    is reachable only through the write path.
///  * `session_handlers.dart:184` + `:303-315` — `subscribe`'s `_classify`,
///    whose own doc says "Phase 6's per-key authorization attaches here: one
///    more arm, no change of shape". It turned out to need no arm at all.
///
/// So filtering one getter gives hiding on five surfaces **byte-identically to
/// a nonexistent tag**, with no edit to either handler file. That is not a
/// coincidence to be grateful for — it is why the answer for an unserved tag
/// was consolidated into one helper in 06-04 first, and it is what
/// `policy_test.dart`'s indistinguishability case exists to keep true.
///
/// ## The four sub-APIs, and all four now decide something
///
/// `browse`, `timeseries`, `historyViews` and `preferences` return wrappers.
/// They are wrapped rather than returned bare so the "no unwrapped source to
/// reach" property holds for them too: a handler that takes `api.browse` gets
/// something this session owns, not the shared object itself.
///
/// Through Phase 9 all four merely delegated, and the reason was that none of
/// their methods was on the wire — the handler table was nine names and the
/// contract legs enumerated thirteen unreachable checks, every one a sub-API
/// method. A policy call nothing can reach would read like coverage while
/// testing nothing, which `suite_integrity_test.dart:104-108` calls worse than
/// an absent one.
///
/// **10-02 registered the four `browse.*` handlers, so browse filters**;
/// **10-03 the four `timeseries.*` ones, so timeseries does too** — each with
/// cases that can see it, and each as an entry in the indistinguishability
/// loop (browse seventh, timeseries eighth). **10-04 filled in history views**,
/// which drops a hidden key from a view rather than the view from the picker,
/// and **10-05 preferences**, which is the one of the four that does not hide
/// anything: it *gates*, because a preference key is not a plant key and the
/// question it settles is who may write `key_mappings`. The rule stands
/// unchanged — a filter lands in the commit that makes the surface reachable,
/// never before it and never after.

///     folder is not one. A node the resolver maps to no key at all — a
///     folder, an intermediate struct, a method — is not asked about and is
///     not dropped. Pruning a folder would take every tag under it off the

///     clearly as a refusal would.

/// Three rules.
///
///  1. **A hidden series is an empty series** — never a refusal. Same
///     argument as everywhere else in this file: a refusal names what it
///     refused, and a station that can tell "hidden" from "nothing recorded"
///     can enumerate the historian by asking.
///  2. **A series the resolver cannot map at all is answered the same way,
///     and is counted.** This is the pairing 10-CONTEXT amendment 6 forces
///     and it is the one a later reader is most likely to try to "fix", so
///     both halves are stated here:
///
///      * The **wire** answer must be indistinguishable from a series that
///        does not exist, because a refusal naming an unmapped table would
///        enumerate the historian exactly as a `forbidden` would (T-10-12).
///      * The **gateway** must not be silent about it, because fail-closed
///        with nothing to read is a chart that renders flat for months while
///        nobody knows a table was never mapped.
///
///     The reconciliation is [SeriesMappingTally]: silence outward, a count
///     and a name inward. Making the refusal informative breaks the first
///     half; dropping the count breaks the second. Neither is an improvement.
///
///     The honest limit, from research §C.2: the mapping covers what the
///     *gateway* collects, so a chart pointed at a pre-cutover table the
///     application's own collector wrote gets nothing until the migration runs
///     or the configuration declares a read-side alias. That is the correct
///     default, and the first time it happens it will look like a database
///     problem (Trap 7). The count is what makes it one query instead of one
///     afternoon.
///  3. **An entry is still returned for every requested series on the
///     multiple path.** A hidden or unmappable series is an *empty* entry,
///     never an omission — an omission would be a perfect existence oracle,
///     and it would also break the rule the contract check names ("an absent
///     entry and an empty entry are different answers and only one of them is
///     true"). The gateway's handler builds the map from the request as well,
///     so this holds twice over; both belts are cheap.
///
/// Note the asymmetry with browse, and do not make the two uniform: an
/// unmappable *node* is left alone there, because a folder legitimately maps
/// to no key, while an unmappable *series* is fail-closed here, because a
/// series always names something recorded.

///
/// Three rules, and the third is a decision rather than a mechanism:
///
///  1. **A hidden key is dropped from a view; the view itself still comes
///     back.** A view that vanished would itself say a view exists — the
///     operator saved it and the picker offered it a moment ago, so its
///     disappearance is a louder statement about the key it held than the
///     key's own absence is (T-10-13). The arm that proves the difference is
///     the boundary one: a view **all** of whose keys are hidden comes back as
///     a view with an *empty* key list. Every other case passes under either
///     rule.
///  2. **Graphs are not filtered.** A graph index is not a key and there is
///     nothing to hide in a title or an axis unit. Filtering them alongside
///     the keys is the plausible over-reach, and it would leave a view whose
///     axes lost their labels for a reason nobody could find.
///  3. **A hidden key is dropped from a *save*, silently** — see
///     [_visibleKeys] for the cost, which is real and is written down there
///     rather than here because that is where somebody will stand.
///
/// [selectHistoryViews] delegates untouched, and that is not an omission:
/// `HistoryViewRecord` carries an id, a name and two timestamps and **no key
/// list**, so there is nothing on it to filter. The keys live behind
/// [getHistoryViewKeys] and [getHistoryViewKeyNames], which are the two
/// methods that do filter.
///
/// ## And since 10-REVIEW CR-03 it also **gates**
///
/// The three rules above are about hiding, and hiding was all this class did:
/// it filtered keys out of views and consulted no identity at all, so a
/// `view`-role wall display could delete every saved chart in the plant while

/// [_OperateGate.requireOperate], the same predicate and the same pre-effect
/// discipline `_PolicyPreferences` uses. [createHistoryView] does not, and
/// [deleteHistoryView] carries the argument for why the line is drawn there.
///
/// Written as explicit member-by-member delegation like everything else in
/// this file — **never `noSuchMethod`**: a forwarder would absorb an interface
/// member added later and serve it unfiltered *and* ungated, which is now two
/// jobs it would be skipping rather than one.

/// Stored preferences: **anyone authenticated may read them, and writing one

/// plant key: `svn.chart.maxPoints` names a row in the gateway's own settings
/// store, and [KeyPolicy] — which answers about tags — has nothing to say about
/// it. So the question this class had to settle was not *which* preferences a
/// station may touch but whether preferences are policed by identity at all.
///
/// ## Why `operate`, and why that is not a new rule
///
/// **`key_mappings`.** That one preference row is the gateway's own routing
/// configuration — 518 KiB of it — and a station that can `setString` it
/// re-points the plant's tag map for every panel on the site. A `view` station
/// doing that is at least as consequential as a `view` station writing a motor
/// setpoint, which is precisely what `operate` already guards. So the rule
/// reused here is [AllVisibleOperatorWrites]'s own, verbatim: everything is
/// readable, and the `operate` role is what a write takes. The comparison
/// below is the only one in this file — one rule, not seven copies of it.
///
/// **No new rule shape**, and that is a deliberate scope fence rather than
/// laziness. A `canWritePreference(String key, Identity)` on [KeyPolicy] would
/// be a second policy surface to keep in step with the first, for behaviour
/// nobody has asked for and no policy data exists to fill; tightening this
/// later — a per-key preference rule, a read rule — stays a change to policy
/// *data* rather than to plumbing, which is the whole point of the Phase 6
/// hiding architecture. The `operate` gate is the safe floor either way.
///
/// ## The refusal is `forbidden`, and here that is the *correct* answer
///
/// Everywhere else in this file a refusal that names what it refused is the
/// leak being closed: answer `forbidden` for a hidden tag and a station can
/// enumerate the plant by asking. Preferences invert that, because **reads are
/// all-visible**. A station that is refused a write has already read the key,
/// or could have; there is no existence left to conceal, and the two facts a
/// client acts on differently are "fix the key name" (`unknownKey`) and
/// "obtain the permission" (`forbidden`). This is the second, and it is the one
/// place in Phase 10 where saying so out loud is right.
///
/// The refusal is also **pre-effect**: raised before the source is touched, in
/// the same shape `value_handlers.dart:445-455` raises it for a plant write —
/// `ServerErrorCodes.forbidden` with a pre-substituted `data`, never
/// `RpcException.invalidParams`, because a refusal with no `data` is the one
/// `serialize` fills in with the offending request (the 02-05 hang). A gate
/// that fired after the write had landed would not be a gate; for
/// `key_mappings` it would be a report that the tag map has already moved.
///
/// ## Secret material is impossible by construction, and not because of this
///
/// Worth stating at the gate, because the two are easy to conflate and the
/// mistake is one-directional. This class is about `key_mappings`. It is **not**
/// what keeps credentials off the pipe: `PreferencesApi` simply omits the
/// `{bool secret = false}` parameter the concrete `Preferences` carries at
/// twelve sites, so there is no route from this wire to the secure store at
/// all, and `api_surface_test.dart` fails if any wire interface ever declares a
/// parameter with that name (SEC-01, T-10-18). A reader who reads this gate as
/// "secrets are handled" will eventually restore the parameter behind it.
///
/// Ruling 1 is **resolved**, not open: the user's 2026-09-02 morning review
