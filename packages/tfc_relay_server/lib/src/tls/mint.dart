/// A private CA and a server leaf, minted in pure Dart.
///
/// SEC-01 asks for tooling that produces a CA root and a gateway leaf. There
/// were three ways to get one (06-RESEARCH §B.2, all three executed):
///
///  1. `X509Utils.generateSelfSignedCertificate`, the route CONTEXT amendment
///     5 named and `packages/tfc_dart/bin/generate_certs.dart` already uses.
///     **Disproved.** `basic_utils` encodes every subject-alternative name as
///     a dNSName — `X509Utils.dart:480-484` is literally
///     `ASN1PrintableString(stringValue: s, tag: 0x82)`, with no parameter to
///     change it — so `10.104.29.71` goes in as the DNS *string*
///     `"10.104.29.71"`. Measured: such a leaf connects when dialled by name
///     and is refused with `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` when dialled by IP
///     literal. The panels dial IPs; ST101/ST201/ST301 are addresses. Latest
///     release is 5.8.2 (2025-02-23), so the defect is unfixed upstream.
///  2. Shell out to `openssl`. Works, and stays a fine provisioning story on
///     a workstation — but `relay-packages-test` runs on `windows-latest`,
///     and a test that needs `openssl` on `PATH` is a lane that goes red for
///     a reason unrelated to this code.
///  3. This file: ~100 lines of `package:pointycastle` ASN.1 with one
///     corrected `GeneralName` encoder. `pointycastle` is `basic_utils`' own
///     and only dependency, so nothing new enters the solve — a transitive
///     edge became direct. `basic_utils` stays, for RSA keygen and PEM
///     encode/parse only, which is the part it gets right.
///
/// `bin/relay_certs.dart` is a shell over these two functions and the tests
/// mint through them too, so the fixtures prove the tool rather than
/// resembling it. A second minting path would be a second place the `0x87`
/// fix has to be remembered.
///
/// Without this file the plant has no certificates at all, and with a
/// "simplified" [_generalName] it has certificates that work on a developer's
/// `wss://localhost` and fail on every panel — with an error message
/// indistinguishable from a wrong CA and from an expired leaf (trap 16).
