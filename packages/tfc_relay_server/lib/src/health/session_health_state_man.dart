/// The half of `PIPE.*` that cannot come from the shared source: the numbers
/// that are true of **one socket**, plus the one number that is true of the
/// process serving them all.
///
/// ## Why this is per session, and why that is the whole point
///
/// `LocalStateMan` is one instance serving every panel in the plant.
/// `PIPE.link_degraded`, `PIPE.effective_hz`, `PIPE.egress_kbps` and
/// `PIPE.pending_keys` are facts about one client's send buffer, one client's
/// tick rate and one client's sink — so served from the shared source they
/// would report whichever client last moved them. A quiet panel in the
/// packing hall would show the busiest panel's degradation, and the engineer
/// reading it would go and look at the wrong machine.
///
/// That is the same argument `policy_state_man.dart` makes about identity, and
/// it is why this overlay is built in `RelayServer._onConnect` rather than in
/// `start()`. The chain order is unchanged and load-bearing — **policy over
/// health over source** — so `canSee` still filters a key list that already
/// contains the health keys, and a policy that hides one hides it here too.
///
/// ## The certificate stays in this package (a deliberate deviation from
/// 08-CONTEXT ruling 9)
///
/// Ruling 9 files `cert.days_to_expiry` among the per-plant facts that belong
/// on `LocalStateMan`. It stays here, and the reason is structural rather
/// than convenient: the number is about the leaf **this process is serving**
/// — a property of the server's `SecurityContext`, read one line after
/// `useCertificateChain` from the very same `TlsConfig` — not a property of
/// the plant. Moving the producer upstream would either strand 06-09's
/// sixteen socket-level cases or force `tfc_relay_server` to hold
/// `tfc_relay_local` as a dev dependency, which puts an open62541 native
/// build in front of this package's suite and destroys the property that
/// justified a separate package in the first place. The *name* still comes
/// from [PipeKeys], so there is still exactly one spelling, and that was the
/// only thing that ever had to be shared.
///
/// ## Two modes, one class
///
///  * **Server mode** ([chainPath] set, [probe] null). One instance, built by
///    `RelayServer.start`, owning the certificate measurement and its store.
///    This is what `RelayServer.certHealth` hands back, and what
///    `cert_health_state_man.dart`'s `CertHealthStateMan` alias names.
///  * **Session mode** ([probe] set, [cert] pointing at the server-mode
///    instance). One per connection, in the chain slot, answering the six
///    per-session keys itself and forwarding the certificate key to the one
///    instance that measured it — so a `refresh()` on the server-mode overlay
///    pushes to every session subscribed to it, which is one store and not
///    one per panel.
///
/// A plaintext gateway has no server-mode instance at all, so a session's
/// [cert] is null and the certificate key is simply absent: a key reading
/// `errorConfig` forever on a gateway that was never given a certificate is a
/// permanent false alarm, which is how an operator learns to ignore the
/// indicator.
///
/// ## No timer, in either mode
///
/// `teardown_test.dart` walks every file under `lib/src`, treats a non-comment
/// `Timer.periodic(` outside `tick_engine.dart` as an offence, and pins the
/// package's repeating-timer count at exactly **one** (03-RESEARCH Finding 8:
/// "a timer that captures a session closure is exactly the ghost 03-11's
/// kill-cycle test hunts"). A per-session object holding one would be that
/// ghost with a health badge on it.
///
/// So the recompute is on a **deadline and on the read path**, never on a
/// clock of its own:
///
///  * the per-session gauges are field reads — a buffer's pending count, two
///    counters and a subtraction — so they are recomputed on every read
///    surface, and [ValueStore.applyBatch] means only a genuine change
///    notifies a subscriber;
///  * the certificate re-reads a file, so it keeps the cert overlay's hourly
///    [period] and its `refreshIfDue` shape. `relay_session.dart`'s `_ping`
///    calls [refreshIfDue] for the same reason it always did — four of the
///    registered methods never read `api.keys`, and `ping` is the one an
///    established panel sends all shift.
///
/// ## Quality, never a zero
///
/// A number that is not yet measurable reads [Quality.errorConfig] with a
/// **null** value, never 0. `effective_hz` before the first tick is *unknown*;
/// zero would mean "the pipe has stopped", which is a different and alarming
/// claim, and an indicator that cries wolf on every fresh connection is one
/// nobody reads. The certificate makes the identical statement about an
/// unreadable chain, and negative days stay a *reading* under good quality
/// because "three days past" is exactly what an engineer needs to know.
