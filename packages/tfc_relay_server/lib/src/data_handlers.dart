/// The bodies of the data-service methods: browse, timeseries, history views,
/// and — from 10-05 — preferences.
///
/// Same rule as `value_handlers.dart` and `session_handlers.dart`, for the same
/// reason: **nothing in here registers anything.** Handlers are handed to
/// `RelaySession._on`, which is the one seam where a method enters the table
/// and therefore the one place the handshake gate and the error armor are
/// applied. A handler that registered itself would be a handler that arrived
/// ungated, and an ungated `browse.fetchRoots` is the plant's whole address
/// space enumerated by a peer that never authenticated. A grep for the peer's
/// registration call over this file is meant to come back empty.
///
/// ## The bodies are copied from the contract kit, never imported
///
/// The contract kit's `served_state_man.dart:482-510` already serves these four
/// methods correctly over its own channel, and this file is a deliberate copy
/// of them rather than a call into it. `handler_table_test.dart:264-296` sweeps
/// this package's production `lib/` for the kit's package name and requires
/// **zero** hits — including in prose, which is why the name is not written
/// anywhere in this file. It is a **dev** dependency, the harness a test suite
/// runs against, and a gateway that imported its test kit at runtime would ship
/// the fake plant, the seeding levers and the fault injectors into the plant.
///
/// So the duplication is the point, and the two copies are expected to drift
/// only where the wire differs: the kit wraps every body in its own `_answer`,
/// and this one does not, because `RelaySession._on` already supplies exactly
/// that armor (`relay_session.dart:813-835`).
///
/// ## What a refusal here looks like
///
/// `_refuse`, copied in shape from `value_handlers.dart:883-885`: the general
/// `RpcException` constructor with INVALID_PARAMS and a **pre-substituted**
/// `data`, never `RpcException.invalidParams`, which takes no `data` — and a
/// refusal with no `data` is exactly the one `serialize` fills in for you with
/// the offending request. One request carrying `1e999` then makes the error
/// itself unencodable, the peer drops it, and a caller with no deadline waits
/// forever (the 02-05 hang).

  /// walk to replace what `_teardown` already does for free; and it would take
  /// the teardown property away from the place that can measure it, because
  /// "the listener came off when the session died" is only assertable when the

  /// conflated** (`session_sink.dart:56-57`, `send_buffer.dart:185-196`). So a
  /// `clear()` over five hundred preference keys, un-coalesced, is five
  /// hundred frames per connected client and then a `BufferDisconnect`, which
  /// `relay_session.dart:416-424` turns into `close(4004)`: a settings page
  /// evicting every panel in the plant and reporting it to the operators as
  /// backpressure (T-10-19).
  ///
  /// The flush is scheduled with **`Timer.run`** — a zero-duration one-shot —
  /// and **not** with `scheduleMicrotask`, which is the shape the contract
  /// kit's own flush uses. That difference was measured rather than assumed,
  /// and the reason is in the source this listens to.
  ///
  /// The kit coalesces changes that arrive from `ValueListenable` callbacks,
  /// which fire **synchronously** inside the loop that made them: by the time
  /// the microtask queue is reached, every key is already pending. A
  /// preference store announces through a broadcast `StreamController`
  /// instead, and an asynchronous broadcast controller delivers one event per
  /// microtask, scheduling the next delivery from inside the previous one — so
  /// a flush scheduled from the first delivery lands in the queue *ahead* of
  /// the second key. Measured with `scheduleMicrotask`: a five-hundred-key
  /// `clear()` produced **five hundred frames, each naming one key**, which is
  /// the exact failure this method exists to prevent.
  ///
  /// A timer callback runs only after the microtask queue has drained
  /// completely, so every delivery of the burst is pending before the flush
  /// looks. It coalesces one *turn* of the event loop rather than one
  /// synchronous block, which is a little wider than the kit's shape and still
  /// nothing to do with wall time: `Duration.zero` cannot make the count a
  /// client sees depend on how fast the machine ran, and the frame is on the
