/// (SEC-03), together with TLS and origin enforcement. SRV-01's "rejects
/// unauthenticated clients" is met today by what the session already refuses:
/// a client that sends any other method before `hello`, a `hello` whose params
/// do not decode, and a `hello` naming no protocol version the server speaks.
/// Those are asserted in `session_hello_test.dart`, so the requirement has
/// teeth now and gains a credential later.
///
/// Writing it as an injected interface rather than a `TODO` is what makes the
/// Phase 6 change a one-line substitution at the call site instead of surgery
/// on the handshake, and what lets this phase test the rejection path — the
/// path that will matter — with a validator that says no.
