///   03-RESEARCH Finding 7 measured a black-holed client — socket open,
///   traffic dropped both directions — being reaped 3.70 s after the blackhole
///   at a 2 s `pingInterval`. That is **1.85×** the interval, and at the
///   design's 20 s it extrapolates to a **~37 second** window in which the
///   gateway still believes a dead panel is alive: still holding its
///   subscriptions, its send buffer, and its upstream monitored items. The
///   project constraint is "half-open connections detected in seconds". So the
///   app-level heartbeat is the reaper and the WS ping is NAT keepalive plus a
///   backstop for the case where the client is alive but its heartbeat logic
///   is broken. Encoding that as a construction rule rather than a convention
///   is what stops the ~37 s hole being configured back in by someone who
///   reads `pingInterval` as the liveness deadline — which is exactly how it
///   reads.
/// * **The stall threshold sits above the noise floor.** Finding 10 measured
///   idle event-loop drift at ±2 ms. A threshold inside that reports a stalled
///   loop on a server doing nothing, and an alarm that is always on is an
///   alarm nobody reads.
/// * **The tick band is 50–100 ms** (SRV-03). Outside it the server still
///   runs and still passes every functional test; it is just a different
///   product. A 500 ms tick is a slideshow of the plant.
