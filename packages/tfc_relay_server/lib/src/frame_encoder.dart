///
/// Pure: no I/O, no clock, no socket. The caller owns the tick.
///
/// **Why this class exists at all.** 03-RESEARCH Finding 2 benchmarked four
/// fan-out strategies at 100 clients × 200 changed keys per tick:
///
/// | strategy | µs/tick |
/// |---|---|
/// | `Peer.sendNotification` (encodes once *per peer*) | 7 639 |
/// | encode the body once, splice per-client envelopes | 110 |
///
/// **69.6×.** `json_rpc_2` wraps each peer's channel in a JSON codec
/// transformer, so the obvious wiring pays the full encode per connected
/// panel, silently: nothing throws, nothing logs, and every functional test
/// still passes. The only symptom is a plant-floor screen falling behind.
/// `frame_encoder_test.dart` counts encoder calls so that regression is caught
/// by an exact integer rather than by a stopwatch on a hosted runner.
///
/// **The honest property is per changed-key set, not per tick.** Finding 3:
/// the shared bytes are the `c`/`q`/`r` body, which is keyed by *handle*, and
/// handles are server-global ([HandleTable]) precisely so two panels watching
/// one motor produce byte-identical bodies. Two panels whose changed-handle
/// sets differ do not share, and cost two encodes. Saying "one encode per
/// tick" would be a promise this code cannot keep, so the tests say the longer
/// thing instead.
///
/// **What is not shared:** `sub` and `seq` are per client, so the envelope is
/// assembled by string concatenation around the pre-encoded body. Building a
/// map and encoding that is the 7 639 µs strategy arrived at by accident.
///
/// Values are not part of the cache signature. Within one tick a handle has
/// one value — it comes from the server's own state — so two clients with the
/// same changed-handle set necessarily have the same changed values. Across
/// ticks that is false, which is why [FrameEncoder.beginTick] clears the
/// cache.
