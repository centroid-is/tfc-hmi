/// This file is where the three pieces the rest of the package builds
/// separately are finally wired together — the send buffer, the session sink
/// and the channel adapter — and it is the only place in the package that
/// knows a socket exists. `RelaySession` deliberately does not (see its own
/// doc): that is what lets every session property be asserted over an
/// in-memory pair in milliseconds, and it is why this file's own test file is
/// short.
///
/// **The accepted divergence from design §5.** The design says the fan-out
/// tick should "drain when the previous write completes", and `dart:io`
/// WebSockets offer no way to know when that is: no `bufferedAmount`, no
/// `flush()`, and an `add` that returns `void` (03-RESEARCH Finding 5, option
/// (a); 03-CONTEXT records the decision). So the safety net is the other one
/// the design already carries — tick-paced draining plus
/// `ConflatingSendBuffer`'s own `poll` verdicts, which measure the backlog the
/// server can see rather than the one the kernel is holding. This is a
/// recorded decision, not an omission, and anyone who later finds a genuine
/// completion signal on this transport should revisit it here first.
///
/// **The single outbound chokepoint.** [writeFrame] is the only function in
/// this package that calls `ws.sink.add`. Everything the server says — RPC
/// answers, write acks, status, and from 03-07 the drained telemetry frame —
/// goes through it, because a second write path is a frame that skips the
/// buffer and therefore skips backpressure accounting entirely.
