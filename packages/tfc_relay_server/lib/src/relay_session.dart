/// One connected client: the JSON-RPC peer, the handler table, and the two
/// pieces of armor every handler is born with.
///
/// The direct ancestor is `served_state_man.dart` in the contract kit — a
/// `Peer` over a `StreamChannel<String>` serving a `StateManApi`, with a
/// registration ledger, error armor and an ordered teardown. This is that
/// class with a gate in front of it and a socket underneath (03-04), and three
/// things are copied from it rather than rewritten, on purpose:
///
///  * the `.._start()` cascade, so registration and listening are one
///    expression and a session cannot exist half-registered;
///  * `registeredMethods`, so the wire surface can be asserted in *both*
///    directions — a declared name with no handler, and a handler nobody
///    declared;
///  * `_answer`/`_substitute`, verbatim, including the explanation. That one
///    is the 02-05 hang trap and the highest-risk item in this phase.
///
/// **What this class does not do.** It does not know what a socket is. The
/// channel arrives built (see `ws_channel.dart`), which is what lets every
/// property below be tested over an in-memory pair in milliseconds instead of
/// over a port. It also does not close its own transport: it closes the peer
/// and then hands the close code to the closer its caller supplied, because
/// only the caller knows whether there is a WebSocket down there and only a

  ///    `params` echoed back into the priority lane, held until the next tick,
  ///    by a peer that has not authenticated. The fallback registered below
  ///    does not stop it; see the comment there for why.
  ///  * **The 02-05 hang, reachable pre-hello** (T-06-18). Add `1e999`
