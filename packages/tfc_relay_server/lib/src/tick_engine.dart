/// The hot path: **one** `Timer.periodic` for the whole server, and the fixed

///
/// **One timer per server, never one per session** (03-RESEARCH Finding 8).
/// The sweep model that finding measured — a `lastSeenMs` field plus a linear
/// scan, 0.05 µs for 100 sessions — is cheaper than the bookkeeping of the
/// alternative, and that is the smaller half of the argument. The larger half
/// is that a timer capturing a session closure is exactly the ghost 03-11's
/// kill-cycle test hunts: the session is closed, the registry no longer holds
/// it, and a `Timer.periodic` somewhere still owns its buffer, its listeners
/// and its socket. `grep -rn "Timer" lib/src/` is meant to find a *repeating*
/// timer in this file and nowhere else. The package's only other `Timer` is
/// `RelaySession._requestClose`'s zero-duration one-shot, which exists to put
/// a teardown behind the refusal that explains it and cannot outlive the turn
/// it was scheduled in — it holds nothing open and it never fires twice.
///
/// **The order inside one tick is fixed, and every step of it is load-bearing:**
///
///  1. `encoder.beginTick()` — the body cache's whole lifetime policy. A body
///     that outlived a tick would ship the previous tick's values under this
///     tick's timestamp.
///  2. `lag.poll(nowMs)` — *inside this callback*, not on a timer of its own
///     (Finding 10). When the loop is frozen both timers are frozen, and only
///     the callback that was supposed to be sending data knows how long the
///     data was not being sent. A stall the fan-out itself caused is visible
///     here and nowhere else.
///  3. per session: `buffer.poll(nowMs)` **before** `drain()`, act on the
///     verdict, drain, write the priority lane, write the conflated telemetry,
///     write the tick notification.
///  4. the heartbeat sweep, once, over every session ([TickEngine.reap]).
///
/// **Why the poll comes before the drain.** `ConflatingSendBuffer.drain()`
/// empties the buffer by contract — "recovery never has a backlog to flush" —
/// so a poll placed after it reads a pending count of zero on every tick and
/// no backpressure verdict can ever fire. The client that cannot keep up then
/// grows the server's heap in silence, which is the failure
/// `ConflatingSendBuffer` exists to convert into a visible reconnect
/// (Finding 5: `dart:io`'s WebSocket has no `bufferedAmount`, so the buffer's
/// own pending count is the *only* backpressure signal there is).
/// `tick_test.dart` asserts the overflow verdict fires with a full buffer,
/// which is the falsification of the wrong order.
///
/// **The accepted divergence, restated at the drain site** (03-CONTEXT;
/// Finding 5). Design §5 says flush when the previous write completes. On
/// `dart:io` WebSockets there is no such signal — no `bufferedAmount`, no
/// `flush()`, an `add` that returns `void` — so tick-paced draining plus the
/// buffer's own verdicts is what §5's flush-gating maps to on this transport.
/// A reader at this line does not have to go and find the plan.
///
/// **What the backpressure verdicts actually measure** (03-REVIEW WR-11, and
/// this is the honest version of the paragraph above). `drain()` runs
/// unconditionally every tick and `ws.sink.add` never blocks, so the buffer is
/// empty at the start of every tick by construction. What `poll` reads is
/// therefore **how much this server produced for one client during one tick** —
/// not how far behind that client is. A genuinely slow client's backlog
/// accumulates in the `dart:io` socket's own unbounded write buffer, which is
/// exactly the thing this process cannot see. So `maxPending` is a
/// per-client *production* ceiling wearing a backpressure ceiling's name, the
/// soft `peakThreshold` window measures sustained heavy production rather than
/// sustained client backlog, and **a slow client is detected only by the
/// heartbeat deadline** — a panel that stops reading stops sending heartbeats,
/// and the reaper is what notices.
///
/// This is the accepted `dart:io` divergence taken to its conclusion rather
/// than a defect in the implementation of a decision, but SRV-04's "convert
/// silent heap growth into a visible reconnect" is only half met and the docs
/// used to read as though it were fully met. Phase 6 has exactly two real
/// options and should choose deliberately: a periodic `ws.sink.done`-based
/// liveness check, or moving to `package:web_socket` if it ever exposes a
/// completion signal.
