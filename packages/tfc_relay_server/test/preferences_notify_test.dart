/// `preferences.changed`, over the wire it actually travels on.
///
/// The handler has existed on the client since 04-REVIEW WR-07 — registered
/// then precisely because *"a handler that does not exist is a different defect
/// from a feature that has not shipped, and only one of the two is fixed by
/// waiting"*. This file is the other half finally arriving, and it judges the
/// three things a sender gets wrong.
///
/// ## Coalescing is a deliverable, not a nicety
///
/// `peer.sendNotification` lands in `SessionSink.add`, which is
/// `buffer.putPriority` — a lane that is byte-capped at 8 MiB, entry-capped,
/// drained only by the tick and **not conflated** (`send_buffer.dart:185-196`).
/// A `clear()` over five hundred preference keys is therefore five hundred
/// frames per connected client, and the verdict at the end of that is a
/// `BufferDisconnect`, which `relay_session.dart:416-424` turns into
/// `close(4004)`. In plant terms: an engineer resets the settings on one
/// laptop and every panel in the fish factory drops its link, reporting
/// backpressure. So the sender buffers keys into a **set** and flushes once on
/// a microtask (T-10-19).
///
/// A microtask rather than a timer, copied from the shape
/// `served_state_man.dart:799-824` already uses: a burst applies
/// synchronously, so by the time the microtask queue drains, every key that
/// burst touched is pending and one frame carries all of them. A timer would
/// coalesce *across* bursts too, which would make the count this file asserts
/// depend on how fast the machine ran.
///
/// ## One listener per session, and each cancels its own
///
/// The gateway serves N sessions from **one shared source**
/// (`relay_server.dart:213-214`, "One instance, shared"), so each session
/// attaches its own listener to the one change stream. The tidier-looking
/// alternative — one server-level subscription fanning out to the registry —
/// is deliberately not what is built, and the reason is in this file: a
/// per-session listener is what makes the teardown arm mean anything, and the
/// fan-out shape would need a session registry of its own to replace what
/// `_teardown` already does for free.
///
/// ## How the counting is done without timing
///
/// Two of the cases below assert **exactly one** frame, which is a claim about
/// something that did *not* arrive. Rather than waiting a while and hoping,
/// they use the lane's own ordering: after the burst, the case makes an
/// ordinary round trip (`ping`) and waits for its answer. Answers and
/// notifications share the priority lane and it is FIFO, so by the time the
/// ping's answer is on the client, every notification queued before it is too.
/// The barrier is the protocol's, not the clock's.
///
/// The cross-client case is the one genuine wall-clock property here — a frame
/// has to cross a socket to a *different* session — so it uses `within` with a
/// deliberately generous budget. The budget is not a latency claim: what is
/// being judged is that the news arrives at all.
