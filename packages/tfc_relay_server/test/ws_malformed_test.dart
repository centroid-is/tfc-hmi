/// The server's decode boundary, driven by the only tool that reaches it.
///
/// `ws_fault_test.dart` breaks bytes and proves the session tears down; it
/// cannot prove anything about the decoder, because RFC 6455's UTF-8 validation
/// sits in front of the decoder and drops the frame with a 1007 (03-RESEARCH
/// Finding 12). `MalformedPeer` corrupts at the **message** level, so every
/// frame it produces is a well-formed WebSocket frame carrying malformed
/// contents — which is exactly, and only, what arrives at
/// `RelaySession`'s decode path. Phase 1's review found the decode boundary was
/// 5 of 5 Critical findings (STATE.md); this file is the server's.
///
/// ## Two rules copied from `malformed_peer_test.dart`, verbatim in intent
///
/// **Never a throws-matcher for a hang.** `json_rpc_2.Peer` wraps its channel
/// in `respondToFormatExceptions`: a frame it cannot parse is answered with
/// `-32700` to the *sender* and the peer carries on, and the caller waiting on
/// a request is never told anything at all. Nine of the thirteen catalogued
/// corruptions therefore leave a request unsettled **forever** with the link
/// still healthy. A hang is asserted here by converting a deadline into a bool
/// and asserting on the bool; a throws-matcher would be asserting that
/// something happened, which is the opposite of the property.
///
/// **Every budget is short and named**, so silence fails fast and the failure
/// names the property instead of the runner's 30-second timeout.
///
/// ## The closing property, which is the point of the file
///
/// A malformed frame may take **one request** down invisibly. It may not wedge
/// the session. So every case ends the same way: the session is still
/// registered, and a following *valid* request still gets its answer inside a
/// budget. That second half is what separates "the decoder rejected something"
/// from "the decoder rejected something and the client is now talking to a
/// corpse".
///
/// ## The highest-risk case in the phase
///
/// `poisonNumber` — `1e999` — is RESEARCH R7 and Pitfall 7, and it has its own
/// named case rather than living only in the sweep. `jsonDecode('1e999')`
/// yields `Infinity` silently, and `RpcException.serialize` copies the
/// offending **request** into `error.data` unless `data.request` is already set
/// (`json_rpc_2-4.1.0/lib/src/exception.dart:46-57`). An error response
/// carrying an Infinity cannot be encoded, so it is discarded *inside* the
/// Peer, and the caller waits forever on a path that has no deadline — Phase 4
/// owns deadlines and does not exist yet. `relay_session.dart`'s
/// `_answer`/`_substitute` is the mitigation (T-03-28) and this case is its
/// teeth: delete `_substitute` and this case fails on its budget rather than
/// passing quietly.
