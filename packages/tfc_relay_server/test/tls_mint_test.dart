/// named — encodes *every* subject-alternative name as a dNSName
/// (`X509Utils.dart:480-484`, `ASN1PrintableString(stringValue: s, tag: 0x82)`),
/// so a leaf provisioned for `10.104.29.71` carries the literal DNS *string*
/// "10.104.29.71", and a panel dialling that IP literal is answered
/// `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED`. The panels dial IPs — ST101/ST201/ST301 are
/// addresses, not names. So the certificate bytes are ours.
///
/// Every case below reads the DER tag byte and never the rendered text: tag
/// `0x82` carrying the characters `127.0.0.1` is *precisely* what the broken
/// encoding produces, so a string comparison passes on the bug. The hostname
/// case is here so a "cleanup" that unifies the two branches the other way —
/// everything an iPAddress — cannot pass either. Between them the two cases
/// pin the branch, which is the whole of the finding (trap 12).
///
/// Without this file, the next person who tidies `_generalName` ships a leaf
/// that works on their laptop (`wss://localhost`) and fails on every panel in
/// the plant, with an error message identical to a wrong CA and to an expired
/// certificate (trap 16).
