/// The session's front door: what a client may do before it has said hello,
/// what a hello buys it, and what a request that cannot be answered does.
///
/// Driven over `channelPair()` — an in-memory `StreamChannel<String>` with a
/// real `json_rpc_2` client on the far end and no sockets anywhere. The socket
/// is 03-04's subject; every property below is a property of the session, and
/// a property that needs a port to be asserted is a property that gets
/// asserted rarely.
///
/// Two of these cases are the verification of something research could only
/// mark [ASSUMED] or measure once:
///
///  * **Pre-hello rejection.** 03-CONTEXT rules that gating lives in the
///    handler wrapper rather than in `registerFallback`, whose behaviour is
///    untested upstream. The wrapper either gates or it does not, and the case
///    below is how we know which.
///  * **The 02-05 hang.** `RpcException.serialize` copies the offending
///    request into `error.data` unless `data['request']` is already set. One
///    request carrying `1e999` decodes to `Infinity`, the error response
///    becomes unencodable, the peer drops it, and a caller with no deadline
///    waits forever. The case below asserts a *bool derived from a deadline*
///    rather than waiting on a matcher, for the reason
///    `malformed_peer_test.dart:1-33` gives: a matcher that waits for
///    something that never happens reports this file's name instead of the
///    broken property.
