/// The whole contract suite, judged over a real WebSocket.
///
/// Phase 1 wrote 44 checks and ran them in memory. Phase 2 ran the same 44 over
/// a real TCP socket through a fault proxy. This file is the third leg, and it
/// costs one line of suite invocation for the reason RESEARCH Finding 12 gives:
/// `ChannelStateMan` and `ServedStateMan` both take a `StreamChannel<String>`,
/// so a WebSocket is a transport swap and nothing else. No framing layer is
/// needed on this leg — the frame *is* the message boundary, which is the one
/// job `lineChannel` had to do for TCP.
///
/// **What passing here buys.** A transport that passes the same suite as the
/// in-memory channel cannot be hiding a framing, ordering or lifetime
/// difference. Those are exactly the three ways a new transport breaks a
/// working protocol: a message split across frames and delivered in halves, two
/// notifications delivered out of order, or a socket whose close races the data
/// in front of it. Each of those turns a specific check red, by name.
///
/// **Why the count is asserted and not the greenness.** Copied wholesale from
/// `channel_full_contract_test.dart:11-31`, because the argument transfers
/// unchanged: a harness has one cheap way to look green, and it is to declare a
/// capability `false`. `supportsDataServices: false` here would delete seven
/// cases, the report would say "skipped" rather than "passed", and the suite
/// would stay green while seven properties went unjudged over this transport
/// forever. So two numbers are checked, from two different places — what the
/// umbrella *registered* under the flags it was given, and what the runner
/// actually *started* — and both against `allContractChecks.length` rather than
/// against a literal, because a literal is a number somebody updates to match.
///
/// The parity claim proper — that this leg passes the same *set* of checks as
/// the other two, not merely the same number — is `ws_parity_test.dart`.
///
/// **No budget argument.** `runStateManContract` takes none, and the socket leg
/// (`socket_contract_test.dart`) did not widen one either: every case wraps its
/// awaits in `within()`, which names the property and gives it a deadline, so a
/// transport too slow for a case fails that case by name instead of being
/// papered over by a wider suite-level number. Loopback WebSocket framing is
/// the same order of cost as loopback TCP, and this leg was written expecting
/// no budget change. If one is ever needed, it belongs in the check that needs
/// it, with the measurement that justified it.
///
/// This file lives in `tfc_relay_server/test/` and never in
/// `tfc_stateman_contract`: the contract package is a dev-dependency of the
/// server, and the reverse edge would make the test kit depend on the thing it
/// judges (T-03-17).
