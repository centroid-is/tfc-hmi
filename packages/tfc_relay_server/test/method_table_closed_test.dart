///
/// `surface_test.dart` freezes the table's *contents* — forty-three bare
/// strings a human edits in a diff. This file is deliberately a different
/// thing: it asserts the table's **shape**, and it never restates a name.
/// Everything below iterates a set that is declared somewhere else, so a
/// thirty-fifth data-service method or a thirteenth harness lever is covered on
/// the day it is added rather than on the day somebody remembers this file
/// exists. The two files would be redundant if this one carried a second copy
/// of the literal, which is exactly why it does not.
///
/// Three properties, and each of them is one sentence from ROADMAP criterion 4:
///
///  * **Every declared name has a handler and every handler has a declared
///    name.** Stated as one equality against `DataServiceMethods.all` so the
///    failure prints the whole difference. `channel_sub_apis_test.dart:78-93`
///    makes the argument one layer down and this is the same argument on the
///    real wire: a declared name with no handler is METHOD_NOT_FOUND from a
///    table claiming to carry it, and a handler with no declared name is
///    surface nobody counted.
///  * **No harness lever is reachable from the wire.** `rpc_names.dart:378-381`
///    declares the lever set as data specifically so this test could iterate it.
///    `seedTimeseries` is the one that matters most: a client that can insert
///    samples can forge history, and a chart is read as evidence
///    (`data_services_contract.dart:78-81`).
///  * **Nothing on this wire takes a statement.** A name sweep, which is
///    mechanical and weak, and a parameter sweep over the four wire interfaces,
///    which is the one that bites — because the shape DB-04 forbids is not a
///    method whose *name* says SQL, it is a method that takes a fragment of one.
///
/// **Falsification is by wrong input, never by a seam in production code.**
/// `surface_test.dart:304-348` established the idiom and this file copies it:
/// every arm that proves a check bites feeds the comparison a deliberately
/// wrong set while leaving the shipped baseline alone. `_registered` has no
/// setter and `_on` is private, and that is correct — the way to show a closure
/// check works is not to open the class so a test can misuse it.
