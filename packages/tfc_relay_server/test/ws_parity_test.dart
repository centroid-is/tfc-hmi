/// One registry, three transports, one pass set.
///
/// `harness_parity_test.dart` in the contract package made this claim about two
/// legs — an in-memory channel and a real TCP socket. This file is the same
/// claim with the WebSocket added, and it lives here rather than there because
/// the WS harness belongs to the server package and the contract package must
/// never gain an edge back to the thing it judges (T-03-17).
///
/// **Why three green files are not this claim.** Each leg has its own contract
/// driver and all three are green. That proves each transport passes the cases
/// somebody pointed at it — not that they pass the same cases. A sub-suite
/// added to one driver and forgotten in another, a factory whose defaults
/// drifted, a case that only ever ran in process: each of those leaves every
/// driver green and this file red.
///
/// **What is compared, and what must never be.** Pass sets — names and
/// outcomes, nothing else. Two measurements make text comparison across these
/// legs actively wrong, not merely fragile:
///
///  * The TCP leg turns an unpaired surrogate into U+FFFD on its way through
///    the framer (`line_channel.dart:31-38`).
///  * The WS leg does not deliver such a frame at all — a UTF-8-invalid payload
///    is dropped and the socket closes 1007 (RESEARCH Finding 12).
///
/// So the same message put in one end comes out as replacement characters on
/// one leg and as nothing at all on another. An assertion comparing that text
/// across legs is asserting each transport's UTF-8 error handling and calling
/// it parity. Timing is out for the reason the two-leg file already gives
/// (RESEARCH Risk 7): a controller delivers on a microtask, a socket goes
/// through the kernel, and the difference is a property of the host's load.
/// `within()` is the mechanism that makes one assertion work on every leg — a
/// case states what must happen and by when, so a leg too slow for a budget is
/// a failed check and the pass sets differ. Which is the signal, reported by
/// name.
///
/// **A fourth leg is one more row.** [_legs] is a table and everything below
/// iterates it. Phase 6's TLS leg should add a row and change nothing else.
///
/// **This sweep is proven to bite.** A parity sweep that cannot notice a broken
/// leg is decoration, and one whose discovery mechanism silently matches
/// nothing passes vacuously — `mode_integrity_test.dart:24-30`'s doctrine. So
/// the last group asserts the swept set is non-empty and as large as the
/// registry, asserts that a sweep with nothing in it reports zero rather than
/// agreement, and runs a deliberately broken implementation from the kit's own
/// sabotage fakes to prove a disagreement is reported by property name.
