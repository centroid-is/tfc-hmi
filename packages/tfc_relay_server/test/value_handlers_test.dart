/// The five value methods, judged as handler bodies rather than over a wire.
///
/// They are called here the way `RelaySession._on` calls them — one
/// `rpc.Parameters`, one answer or one `RpcException` — with a hand-cranked
/// clock, because everything the outcome log promises is arithmetic about
/// *when* a command was seen and nothing about how long a test is willing to
/// sleep. Registration is 04-02 task 2's subject and is asserted over a real
/// socket in `surface_test.dart`; what is asserted below is what each body
/// answers once it has been reached.
///
/// Two of these cases exist because the wrong answer is worse than no answer:
///
///  * **`not_received` is a licence to re-actuate.** It is the one outcome
///    that tells an operator a re-send is safe, so a gateway that has merely
///    *forgotten* a command must never spell its amnesia that way. The
///    aged-out case below is the one that separates "we never saw it" from
///    "we no longer remember it".
///  * **A non-finite `expect` is not a value to clean up.** Null is this
///    path's encoding of "no compare-and-set guard", so sanitizing an
///    `Infinity` away turns "only if it still reads 1200" into "whatever it
///    reads" — a guarded write silently made unconditional
///    (`messages.dart:373-401`, `channel_state_man.dart:229-250`).
