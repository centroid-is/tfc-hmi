/// The gateway half of hold-to-run, judged where it can hurt somebody.
///
/// Three properties, and none of them is "the feature works" — that is
/// asserted next door in `value_handlers_test.dart`, where the write path's
/// hold branch is judged as a handler body. What is here is what happens when
/// the hold is fed by the wrong peer, by nobody, or after the panel has gone
/// home:
///
///  * **The tick is an authorization boundary** (D-P5-G, T-05-16). `'h'` is an
///    un-idded, unanswered frame that moves a plant tag, and the only thing
///    standing between it and a write primitive is the per-session hold map.
///    A tick naming a key this session never engaged is dropped, counted, and
///    never answered — silently, because a throw at 10 Hz is a log flood
///    (`json_rpc_2` hands a notification's exception to `onUnhandledError`
///    rather than to the client; measured, 05-RESEARCH §B.1 #2).
///  * **A hold dies with the session** (T-05-20). The map is per-session state
///    on `ValueHandlers`, so `RelaySession._teardown` — the one body every way
///    of ending a session arrives at — releases every hold it engaged. A hold
///    that outlived its socket is a machine fed by nobody.
///  * **Nothing advances a counter but a tick** (D-P5-J, assumption A5).
///    05-RESEARCH §G.4 argued the gateway needs no expiry timer of its own,
///    because if ticks stop the counter stops and the PLC's ~1 s deadman drops
///    the output. That argument has a premise — *no ticks means no advance* —
///    and the last group in this file is the standing proof that the premise
///    is true of the code and not only of the reasoning. It is the assumption
///    in that document with the highest consequence if wrong: a wedged gateway
///    driving a counter with nobody feeding it is a machine running
///    unattended.
///
/// **Why the counter the plant sees is the gateway's and not the frame's.**
/// The tick frame carries `n`, and this handler decodes it, validates it, and
/// then does not use it as the value: the advance is `HoldHandle.tick()`,
/// which mints the next value from the handle the *engage* created. That is
/// deliberate. Trusting `n` would let any peer past the handshake put an
/// arbitrary integer on a deadman tag through a path with no cmd, no outcome
/// and no refusal — which is the same door the write path's "a hold write
/// carrying 7 is refused" closes from the other side.
