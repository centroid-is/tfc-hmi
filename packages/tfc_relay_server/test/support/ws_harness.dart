/// Two legs over a real WebSocket, and one rule they share.
///
/// [relayFixture] is the **production** leg: the real [RelayServer], a raw
/// client socket, and a `FakeStateMan` behind the server so a case can drive
/// the plant and watch what a client sees. Every case in this phase that needs
/// a port is built on it.
///
/// [wsServedFake] is the **contract** leg: a `ServedStateMan` and a
/// `ChannelStateMan` on either end of a real WebSocket, with no relay session
/// between them. It exists to prove the transport — which is what makes
/// running the shared 44-check suite over WS (03-06) mean anything — and its
/// defaults are copied from `channelServedFake` and `socketServedFake`
/// verbatim. That copying is deliberate and is called out at each argument:
/// the parity sweep runs one registry through all three legs, so a defaults
/// difference between them reads as a *transport* difference and sends someone
/// looking for a bug in the socket layer that is really a `staleAfter` of
/// 300 ms against one of 500 (`socket_harness.dart:137-145`).
///
/// **Nothing here throws out of the wiring.** A failure while binding,
/// proxying or connecting is delivered to the thing the case is awaiting — the
/// client's channel for the contract leg, the `ready` future for the
/// production one — because an exception raised from a listener callback lands
/// in the ambient isolate and `package:test` attributes it to whichever case
/// is running when it arrives.
