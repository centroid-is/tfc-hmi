/// SRV-04: the send buffer's verdicts, as behaviour a client can see.
///
/// Three arms, and they are deliberately different *kinds* of test:
///
///  * **F12/F19 hard overflow** — integration, over a real socket. The property
///    is not "the buffer returned a `BufferDisconnect`" (the protocol package
///    already owns that) but "a client that blew the ceiling learns why", and
///    only a real close frame carries a 4xxx code and a reason string.
///  * **F20 sustained peak** — a unit test with an injected clock.
///    `ConflatingSendBuffer.poll(nowMs)` takes its timestamp as an argument, so
///    the whole window is arithmetic; asserting it against wall time would be
///    a ten-second sleep that measures the runner (03-RESEARCH Finding 5).
///  * **F21 throttled client** — integration through a [FaultProxy], because
///    the property is about what a *slow link* does to a client, and a slow
///    link is not something a fake can be honest about.
///
/// **Whose close code these arms read.** The client's, always. Finding 6
/// measured a 4004 arriving intact at the far end while the server's own
/// `WebSocketChannel.closeCode` read `null` for the close it had just
/// initiated (`web_socket_channel` #1698) — so on the server side there is
/// nothing to assert, and `RelaySession.sentCloseCode` records an *intention*
/// rather than an observation. `RelayFixture.observedClose` is the evidence.
///
/// **The bite this file is proof against.** `tick_engine.dart` polls the buffer
/// *before* it drains it, and the overflow arm is what fails if that order is
/// ever swapped: `drain()` empties the buffer by contract, so a poll placed
/// after it reads a pending count of zero on every tick and no backpressure
/// verdict can fire again — the slow client then grows the server's heap in
/// silence, which is the exact failure `ConflatingSendBuffer` exists to convert
/// into a visible reconnect.
