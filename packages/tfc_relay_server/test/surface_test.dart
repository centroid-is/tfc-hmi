/// The method table of the wire, written down.
///
/// This test exists to break the build on purpose. Every name below is a thing
/// a connected client may ask the gateway to do, so the set of names *is* the
/// access-control policy: capability is defined by surface. Registering a
/// handler on [RelaySession] without editing this file fails; editing this
/// file is the deliberate act that says "yes, the wire may now do this too".
///
/// The expected sets are hand-written literals, never derived from the class
/// they check. A set computed from the session — or spelled with the protocol
/// package's own name constants — would agree with any change and assert
/// nothing. The point is that a human reads a diff of these lines, so the
/// literals are bare strings and the wire spelling is repeated here on
/// purpose. (That is also why the constants class is not imported below: a
/// reference to it would make this file track the very thing it is pinning.)
///
/// Two properties are enforced here:
///
///  * **Closure, in both directions.** The session registers exactly these
///    forty-three names. One direction alone is half a check: a declared name
///    with no
///    handler answers METHOD_NOT_FOUND from a table claiming to carry it, and
///    a handler under a name nobody wrote down is surface nobody counted. The
///    argument is `suite_integrity_test.dart:22-33`, applied server-side.
///  * **Notifications are not handlers.** The six names the server *sends*
///    are listed in their own literal and asserted absent from the handler
///    table. A notification registered as a handler is a request a client
///    could make of the server — the wrong direction on a one-way name.
///
/// **Direction is the whole of the third literal.** A client→server
/// notification is a name the server *receives*, so it belongs in the handler
/// table's ledger — `json_rpc_2` dispatches a frame with no `id` through the
/// same `_methods[name]` table a request goes through — and it does **not**
/// belong in [expectedNotifications], which is the set of names the server
/// *sends*. The two are asserted disjoint, so a client notification put in the
/// wrong literal fails rather than quietly widening what a client may call.
/// [expectedClientNotifications] is that third set, and the closure checks
/// compare the ledger against the union.
///
/// One asymmetry a reader has to be told about (**D-P5-H**): every `_gated`
/// refusal in this server is visibly answered *except* a refused client
/// notification. A `'h'` frame arriving before `hello` is refused by the gate
/// and the refusal evaporates — the frame has no `id`, so `json_rpc_2` returns
/// before building a response and hands the exception to `onUnhandledError`
/// instead (measured, 05-RESEARCH §B.1 #2). Silence there is the gate working,
/// not the gate missing.
///
/// The session publishes its own ledger (`registeredMethods`), so no
/// reflection is needed: `dart:mirrors` would read the class where the ledger
/// already reads the registrations, and the registrations are what ship.
///
/// **Phase note.** Phase 4 pulled `write`, `writeStatus`, `read`, `readFresh`
/// and `readMany` forward from Phase 5: 04-RESEARCH Finding 4 ran the method
/// sweep against a live server and found all five answering `-32601`, which
/// put 28 of the contract suite's 44 checks out of reach over the real
/// gateway. Phase 5 still owns their *semantics* (three-state depth beyond the
/// plumbing, idempotency windows, hold-to-run) and Phase 10 adds the
/// data-service methods. Each of those is an edit to [expectedHandlerTable]
/// below, made by a human, in a diff.
///
/// **Phase 10 plan 02** made the first of those edits: the four `browse.*`
/// names. It is the shape every later data-service plan copies — the handler
/// bodies land, this literal grows in the same commit, and the contract legs'
/// gap lists shrink by the checks the handlers just made reachable. **Plan 03
/// made the second**, the four `timeseries.*` names; **plan 04 the third**, the
/// eleven `historyViews.*` names; and **plan 05 the last**, the fifteen
/// `preferences.*` ones. The table is now the whole of the thirty-four
/// data-service methods plus the nine that came before them, and both socket
/// legs name no gap at all.
