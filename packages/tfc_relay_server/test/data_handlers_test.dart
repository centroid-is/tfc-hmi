/// The data-service handler bodies, judged as bodies rather than over a wire.
///
/// Called the way `RelaySession._on` calls them — one `rpc.Parameters` in, one
/// answer or one `RpcException` out — which is `value_handlers_test.dart`'s
/// dialect and for the same reason: registration is asserted over a real
/// socket in `surface_test.dart` and `ws_malformed_test.dart`, so what is left
/// for this file is what each body *answers* once it has been reached.
///
/// Two distinctions carry the file, and both are the kind that a plausible
/// implementation gets wrong silently:
///
///  * **Null is not the empty list.** `resolvePath` answers null for a target
///    that does not exist and a list for one that does. An empty list would
///    claim the target sits zero nodes from a root, and a panel restoring a
///    saved selection would render a breadcrumb with nothing in it instead of
///    dropping the pre-selection (`served_state_man.dart:501-507`).
///  * **A wrong-shaped parameter is a refusal, not a crash.** Every refusal on
///    this wire carries a pre-substituted `data.request`, because
///    `RpcException.serialize` otherwise copies the offending request into the
///    error — and one request carrying `1e999` then makes the *error*
///    unencodable, at which point the peer drops it and a caller with no
///    deadline waits forever (the 02-05 hang).
///
/// **10-03** adds the timeseries four. Their arguments are not decoration: two
/// of the four frozen signatures carry a string that upstream interpolates
/// straight into SQL (`database_drift.dart`'s `tableQuery`, `database.dart`'s
/// `countTimeseriesDataMultiple`), so what those bodies *refuse* is as much of
/// the surface as what they answer. The hostile half lives in
/// `hostile_params_test.dart`; what is here is the ordinary shape of an answer
/// and the one refusal that is about size rather than about shape.
///
/// **10-04** adds the history-view eleven, and two of the cases below carry a
/// weight no other case in this file does.
///
/// The contract kit covers nine of the eleven through two checks. It covers
/// **neither** `historyViews.getGlobalRetentionHorizon` **nor**
/// `timeseries.countTimeseriesDataMultiple`, and it may not be made to:
/// `data_services_contract.dart:4-30` is an explicit scope boundary forbidding
/// an eighth data-services case there, on the argument that a weak version of a
/// Phase 10 property frozen as contract is harder to correct than an honest
/// silence. So for those two methods **this file is the only judge there is**.
/// A gateway could answer both of them wrong — a horizon an hour off, a bucket
/// map keyed the wrong way — and every leg of the contract suite would stay
/// green. Each of the two cases says so at its own site, because the sentence
/// is only useful where somebody is about to edit the thing.
