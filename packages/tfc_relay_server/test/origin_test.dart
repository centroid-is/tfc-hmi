/// `allowedOrigins`: SEC-03's cross-site-WebSocket-hijacking clause, refused
/// before the 101.
///
/// A browser page on any origin can open a WebSocket to any host it likes —
/// there is no same-origin policy on the WebSocket handshake, only an `Origin`
/// header the server is expected to judge. Against this gateway that would be
/// a page rendering the plant's values and, with a token in hand, actuating
/// it. `shelf_web_socket` does the judging
/// (`web_socket_handler.dart:71-77`), the wiring already passes the list from
/// the config rather than a literal (`relay_server.dart`, threat T-03-10), and
/// 06-RESEARCH §F measured all nine configurations. So what Phase 6 owes SEC-03
/// is **evidence, not a change** — these arms, and the pin below.
///
/// **The pin is the point.** The check is skipped entirely when the configured
/// list is `null`: `origin != null && _allowedOrigins != null && !contains(…)`.
/// So `null` does not mean "no restriction configured yet", it means
/// "cross-site WebSocket hijacking is permitted", and in a diff it reads
/// almost exactly like the empty list that means the opposite. The type is the
/// only thing between those two, which makes the type a tested property.
///
/// Nullability is **not visible to `dart:mirrors`** — measured here: a
/// `List<String>?` field reports `reflectedType` of `List<String>` and
/// `reflectType(Null).isSubtypeOf(field.type)` of `false`, identically to the
/// non-nullable declaration. So the pin is three cheap mechanisms rather than
/// one reflected type: the declaration's own source text, the default value at
/// runtime, and the reflected type family.
///
/// Every arm runs over **plaintext** on purpose. The origin check happens at
/// the HTTP upgrade, above TLS; running these through wss would make a failure
/// ambiguous between a refused origin and a certificate the client would not
/// take.
///
/// Without this file, the one defence between a malicious page and the plant
/// is a default nobody has ever asserted.
