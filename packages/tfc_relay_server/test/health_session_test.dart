/// HLTH-01's server-side half: the numbers a panel can only learn about
/// **its own link**, and HLTH-02's lane split.
///
/// ## Why a per-session producer at all
///
/// `LocalStateMan` is one instance serving every panel in the plant, and
/// `PIPE.link_degraded`, `PIPE.effective_hz`, `PIPE.egress_kbps` and
/// `PIPE.pending_keys` are facts about *one socket*. Served from the shared
/// source they would report whichever client last moved them — so a quiet
/// panel in the packing hall would show the busiest panel's degradation, and
/// an engineer looking at it would go and investigate the wrong machine.
///
/// That is the same argument `policy_state_man.dart` makes about identity,
/// and it is why the overlay in the chain slot is built in `_onConnect`
/// rather than in `start()`. The isolation case below is the executable form
/// of it; the build-once sabotage recorded in 08-12-SUMMARY is what proves
/// the case can fail.
///
/// ## The lane split
///
/// The priority lane is documented as never conflated, so a fast-moving gauge
/// put there is a queue — and a queue is what the core value forbids outright.
/// `PipeKeys.ridesPriorityLane` partitions the namespace by suffix: the news
/// (`connected`, `state`, `link_degraded`, `last_error`, `epoch`,
/// `birth_count`, `last_death_at`) is never conflated, the telemetry
/// (`rtt_ms`, `data_age_ms`, `effective_hz`, `egress_kbps`, `pending_keys`,
/// `event_loop_lag_ms`, `days_to_expiry`) is. This file asserts the *arrival*
/// of the news on a throttled subscription, never the ordering of two
/// instants, because an ordering assertion between two frames produced in the
/// same tick is a race dressed as a property.
