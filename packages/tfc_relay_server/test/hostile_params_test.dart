/// The input-validation surface for the timeseries family: what a client may
/// put in each of the seven parameters, and what happens to everything else.
///
/// ## Why this file exists at all
///
/// `TimeseriesApi`'s four signatures were frozen verbatim from working code,
/// and two of them carry a string that ends up inside a SQL statement:
///
///  * `orderBy` reaches
///    `'SELECT $cols FROM "$tableName"$whereClause$orderByClause'`
///    (`database_drift.dart`'s `tableQuery`), unescaped, in a position where a
///    subquery is legal grammar.
///  * `tableName` reaches `FROM "$tableName"` in
///    `countTimeseriesDataMultiple` (`database.dart`) **with no
///    quote-doubling at all** — while `queryTimeseriesDataDownsampled`, in the
///    same file, does `tableName.replaceAll('"', '""')`. That is one codebase
///    being inconsistent about one hazard, which is the strongest possible
///    argument for not relying on it.
///
/// Mapping those onto the wire without a validation layer ships the
/// `query(sql)` RPC the project forbids, wearing a signature nobody reads as
/// one. So the gateway does not *sanitize* `orderBy` — it **refuses** it. A
/// sanitizer invites the question of whether it is complete; a two-value
/// allow-list does not, and the contract's own fake proves nothing more is
/// asked for: `FakeTimeseries` implements ordering as
/// `_descending(orderBy) ? window.reversed.toList() : window`, which is two
/// values and a default.
///
/// ## The allow-list is in the handler, and that is deliberate
///
/// Not in the database. `tfc_dart`'s database layer is shared with an
/// application that has always passed its own literals, so moving the check
/// down would either change `tfc_dart`'s behaviour for the app or leave the
/// gateway trusting that it did. The gateway does not trust a client-supplied
/// SQL fragment; it refuses one, at the boundary, where the client is.
///
/// ## Every refusal here is pre-effect
///
/// 05-03's discipline: `INVALID_PARAMS` means *no effect*, so every case
/// below asserts the source recorded **zero** calls. That is the assertion
/// that distinguishes a guard from a filter applied to an answer already
/// fetched — and a guard that runs after the query has already run is not a
/// guard against a query.
