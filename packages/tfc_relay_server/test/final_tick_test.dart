/// What a planned drain owes the client, and what the gateway is allowed to
/// call itself.
///
/// ## The final tick
///
/// A gateway going down on purpose closes every session with
/// [CloseCodes.serverDraining] — 4002, whose documented meaning is "reconnect,
/// do not alarm". What it did not do was say *where each subscription got to*,
/// so a panel reconnecting after a deploy could not tell a sequence it missed
/// from one that never happened, and had no way to know whether the values on
/// its screen were the last ones the gateway evaluated. That is the
/// repudiation half of T-08-48: a client unable to account for what it missed.
///
/// So a planned drain emits one last `tick` naming each subscription's last
/// `seq`, **as its own frame, flushed before the close**.
///
/// ## Why it is a frame and not a close reason
///
/// This is Phase 6's bonus bug, and it is worth re-living once rather than
/// inheriting. RFC 6455 caps a close reason at 123 bytes and
/// `package:web_socket` enforces the cap with an `ArgumentError`
/// (`utils.dart:18`). That throw lands inside `_Connection.closeSocket`'s
/// `try`, is swallowed as "the far end is already gone", and **the socket is
/// never closed** — so a close code the gateway believes it sent was never
/// sent and the session lives on. Splicing a sequence number into the reason
/// would put every planned drain one long station name away from that. The
/// clamp at the close seam is the belt; this file's long-reason arm is the
/// brace, and the sabotage recorded in 08-12-SUMMARY is what proves the arm
/// can fail.
///
/// ## `publisherId`
///
/// The Sparkplug adoption from 07-RESEARCH-PUBSUB: the gateway can name
/// itself, so a plant that runs two of them can tell whose `ST201` an alias
/// belongs to. Advisory — nothing routes on it — and **additive**: an
/// unconfigured deployment's `hello` is byte-identical to the one it sent
/// before this key existed, which is what the captured literal below pins.
