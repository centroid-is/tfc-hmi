/// SEC-04: how many days are left on the gateway's certificate, as an ordinary
/// subscribable key.
///
/// **Health is a key, not a method**, and that is a recorded ruling in three
/// places (`state_man_api.dart:45-49`, `tfc_stateman_contract.dart:52-57`,
/// `api_surface_test.dart:48-51`): "There is no health method. `PIPE.*` keys
/// are subscribable like any plant tag … `listen('PIPE.connected')` is the
/// health API." So the thing under test here is a *producer*, not an endpoint,
/// and every case asks the gateway the way a mimic would.
///
/// ## What breaks in the plant without this file
///
/// The gateway's leaf is a one-year certificate (06-CONTEXT decision 3). On
/// the morning it lapses, every panel in the plant stops connecting at once —
/// `tls_test.dart`'s expired arm is what that looks like from the panel's
/// side, and it is deliberately loud. Loud on the day of the expiry is a
/// Saturday outage; loud thirty days earlier is a Tuesday ticket. This file is
/// what makes the second one possible. The threshold is AlarmMan's rather than
/// ours: the gateway ships the number.
///
/// ## Three answers, and two of them are not numbers
///
///  * A **good** certificate reads whole days, `notAfter - now`, truncated.
///  * An **expired** one reads a negative number, which is meaningful.
///  * An **unreadable** one reads [Quality.errorConfig] and **never 0** — a 0
///    reads as "expires today" and would send somebody to re-issue a
///    certificate that is fine, because a path was misspelled.
///
/// Certificates are minted at test time through `test/support/certs.dart` and
/// never committed: a committed leaf rots on a schedule nobody watches, and
/// the near-expiry one this file needs is a `notAfter:` argument against the
/// cached keypair (~15 ms), not a second keygen.
