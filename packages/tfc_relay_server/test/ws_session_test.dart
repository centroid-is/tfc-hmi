/// SRV-01 over a real WebSocket: the same session properties `session_hello_test`
/// proves in memory, asserted across a real upgrade on an ephemeral port — plus
/// the two things only a socket can answer.
///
/// **Why re-assert in-memory properties over a port.** A framing or gating
/// mistake does not show up on a `channelPair()`: the pair delivers whole
/// strings by construction and the session's gate runs the same either way.
/// The upgrade is where a message boundary can be invented, where a response
/// can be written to a sink nobody drains, and where a close code can be
/// dropped. Everything below is a property of the *transport plus the session*,
/// which is a different subject from either alone.
///
/// **Every close-code assertion here is on the client's observation.** A
/// server's own socket reports a null close code after a close it initiated
/// (`web_socket_channel` #1698 / dart-lang/http#1698, reproduced server-side in
/// 03-RESEARCH Finding 6), so a test that read the server's socket would pass
/// just as happily against a server that closed with no code at all. The
/// session's `sentCloseCode` is the server-side record and is asserted in
/// `session_hello_test`; what is asserted here is that the code survives the
/// wire. The one place the *server's* observation is trustworthy is a close the
/// **client** initiated — that is the 1005 case.
