/// The freshness half of the contract: whether the number on the screen is
/// still true, and how the operator finds out that it is not.
///
/// This is the file the project's core value is written down in — *operators
/// can always trust what the screen shows: values are fresh or visibly stale*.
/// Everything else in the suite is about delivering values correctly and
/// cheaply; these cases are about the one failure that delivers nothing at all
/// and looks perfect while doing it. A page whose subscription died an hour ago
/// renders the same numbers, in the same colour, at the same refresh rate, as a
/// page watching a running plant. Nobody can see the difference by looking, so
/// the source has to say so.
///
/// Every case here is written from `relay-comm-design.md` rather than mirrored
/// from working code: RESEARCH grepped the existing codebase for
/// `sourceTimestamp`, `statusCode` and `DataValue` and found nothing — today's
/// values carry neither quality nor a timestamp, and no widget reads one. That
/// makes the sabotage variants in `broken_freshness.dart` unusually important:
/// with no incumbent behavior to compare against, `ServesStaleReads` and
/// `LiesAboutQuality` are the only evidence that these checks would catch the
/// two ways a real implementation will fail.
///
/// Four properties, in the order an operator meets them:
///
///  * **A value ages.** Past [StateManHarness.staleAfter] it reports
///    [Quality.badStale] through every read path, and going stale is itself a
///    change listeners hear about — the box greys out by itself.
///  * **A link dies.** Every affected key degrades to [Quality.badCommFault],
///    and the loss is announced **once**, not once per key.
///  * **The pipe reports on itself.** `PIPE.*` health keys are subscribable
///    like any plant tag (design §4.7, HLTH-01) and are excluded from their own
///    freshness accounting (HLTH-02) — a key that only changes when the link
///    changes is *always* older than the deadline on a healthy pipe, and
///    staling it would grey out the one indicator that says whether to trust
///    the rest of the screen.
///  * **Quality never heals on its own.** Only a new reading can improve it.
///
/// Timing is wall clock against the deadline the implementation declares,
/// because a freshness watchdog is precisely the machinery an injected clock
/// stops testing (CONTEXT's test-realism policy). There are no sleeps: where a
/// case needs to establish that the deadline has passed, it awaits a
/// notification that the deadline *causes* — a plant key going stale is both
/// the event and the proof, and it arrives as early as the implementation can
/// manage rather than as late as a hard-coded delay would.
