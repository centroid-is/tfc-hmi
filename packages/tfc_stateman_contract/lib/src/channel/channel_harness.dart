/// The factory a contract driver calls: a `FakeStateMan` on the far side of a
/// channel, and a `StateManApi` on this one.
///
/// One function, synchronous, with the reference implementation's own
/// constructor arguments on it. All three of those are constraints rather than
/// preferences:
///
///  * **Synchronous**, because `runSubscribeContract` and every other sub-suite
///    take a `StateManApi Function()` and call it inside the case. A factory
///    that returned a future would force every driver to be rewritten, which is
///    the one thing this harness exists to avoid.
///  * **Same arguments as `FakeStateMan`**, because a driver configures the
///    source it is judging — `test/write_contract_test.dart` declares a
///    read-only key, the freshness driver passes a shorter `staleAfter` — and a
///    channel-served source that could not be configured the same way would
///    make the two drivers diverge in exactly the place the harness is claiming
///    they do not.
///  * **Disposal cascades**, because the driver registers `api.dispose` and
///    nothing else. See `ChannelStateMan.dispose`.
///
/// The corruption hook is threaded through from [ChannelPair] so plan 02-10 can
/// point the malformed-peer catalogue at a fully-served source without adding a
/// second factory.
