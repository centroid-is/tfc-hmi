/// The method names this harness speaks — and why they are not the wire's.
///
/// There are two method tables in this repository and there have to be.
/// `packages/tfc_relay_protocol/lib/src/methods.dart` is the real one: the
/// names on it are, by construction, things any connected client may invoke,
/// which is why `test/api_surface_test.dart` writes the surface down as
/// literals and fails when it grows. This table is the other one, and every
/// name below that is not reused from the real table exists only so a test can
/// make a value arrive.
///
/// That distinction is the whole reason for the file. Half the names here —
/// [setValue], [dropKey], [disconnectUpstream] — are levers that stand in for
/// the plant. `lib/src/harness.dart:39-44` already makes the argument from the
/// other side: those levers are kept off `StateManApi` because "a method that
/// exists is a thing any connected client may invoke, so adding one is an
/// access-control decision, not a convenience". A harness that declared them in
/// `Methods` would hand that decision to whoever next copies a constant, and a
/// gateway registering the harness table by accident would let a connected
/// client tell the plant what the plant is reading. So they live here, in a
/// `publish_to: none` test-kit package that no server imports, under a
/// [prefix] that makes the boundary greppable.
///
/// Three names *are* reused from the real table, because the real table already
/// names the concept and inventing a second spelling would make the harness
/// prove a property against a name that does not ship: `Methods.write` and
/// `Methods.update` are used verbatim.
///
/// `Methods.subscribe` is deliberately **not** reused, and its absence is a
/// decision rather than an oversight. This harness carries the served source's
/// whole store: there is one session, it opens with a snapshot and every later
/// change is pushed. Per-key subscription accounting — handles, unsubscribe,
/// which client asked for what — is Phase 3's session layer, and borrowing the
/// wire's name for something that does not do that would make a later reader
/// believe subscription semantics had already been proven over this channel.
