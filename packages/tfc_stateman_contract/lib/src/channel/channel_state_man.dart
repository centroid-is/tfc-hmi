/// A `StateManApi` whose values only ever arrive over a channel.
///
/// This is the implementation the contract suite is pointed at, and its
/// defining property is negative: it holds no source. Every value it can return
/// got into its [ValueStore] by way of an inbound [Methods.update]
/// notification, and there is no other path — which is exactly the claim
/// `test/channel/channel_bite_test.dart` exists to make honest, by cutting the
/// channel and showing the same named checks fail rather than pass from a
/// local object nobody noticed was there.
///
/// It is a rehearsal for Phase 4's `RemoteStateMan`, deliberately: same store,
/// same synchronous-answers-from-cache shape, same `subscribe` adapter over the
/// same node. What it is missing is everything a socket forces — reconnect,
/// resync, sequence gaps, per-request deadlines — and the missing pieces are
/// listed rather than stubbed, so nothing here can be mistaken for a client
/// that has already solved them.
///
/// ## Where each member gets its answer
///
/// **From the local store, synchronously:** [listen], [read], [keys],
/// [subscribe]. That is the interface's own design (`state_man_api.dart:90-96`:
/// `read` is "synchronous and never a round trip"), and it is what makes the
/// bite-proof meaningful — a store fed by nothing answers nothing.
///
/// **Over the channel, as a request:** [readFresh], [readMany], [write]. Each
/// is one message out and one back, which is what makes the served source's
/// round-trip counter a measurement of *this* object's wire behaviour.
///
/// **Over the channel, as a notification:** every `StateManHarness` lever. They
/// are `void` on the interface, so there is nothing to await; what makes a
/// lever-then-request sequence correct is the channel's ordering, not an
/// acknowledgement.
///
/// **Not over the channel at all:** [staleAfter], [roundTrips] and
/// [statusNotifications], which are read straight off the served instance.
/// `lib/src/harness.dart:16-25` explains why they exist and why they are not on
/// `StateManApi`: they are promises about a *count*, and putting them on the
/// wire surface would make them things a connected client may invoke, which is
/// an access-control decision rather than a testing convenience. There is
/// therefore nothing for a channel to carry, and mirroring them would be
/// inventing wire traffic to move a number that is already correct.
///
/// The last of those is worth stating as a property rather than an excuse.
/// Because the *served* source increments `roundTrips` once per answer it
/// gives, a client that wrongly issued one request per key instead of one
/// [readMany] still shows up as N. The counter lives on the server and measures
/// the client, which is the only arrangement that survives Phase 4, where the
/// counter genuinely will be on another host.
///
/// **The four data-service sub-APIs, over the channel too.** Browse,
/// timeseries, history views and preferences are thirty-four requests and one
/// outbound notification, forwarded by `channel_sub_apis.dart`. They were
/// stubs that threw until plan 02-08, deliberately — a getter returning an
/// empty implementation would have let `runDataServicesContract` run against a
/// channel carrying nothing and report a colour — and what replaced them is
/// forwarding, not a second store: the only thing on this side that holds
/// data-service state is the preference change stream's fan-out, and every key
/// it reports arrived over the channel.
///
/// ## What is not implemented, and why it is not stubbed
///
/// Reconnect, resync, sequence gaps and per-request deadlines. All four are
/// what a socket forces and a `StreamChannelController` does not, and each is
/// listed here rather than approximated so that nothing in this file can be
/// mistaken for a client that has already solved them.
