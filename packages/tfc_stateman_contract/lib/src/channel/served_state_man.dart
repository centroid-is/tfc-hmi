/// Serving a `StateManApi` — and its test-only levers — over a message channel.
///
/// This is the source side of the harness: a `json_rpc_2.Peer` that answers the
/// value path from a real implementation and pushes that implementation's
/// changes outward as [Methods.update] notifications. Phase 3's session layer
/// will do the same job for real, over a socket, with authentication and
/// per-key subscription accounting in front of it. This is not that. It is the
/// channel the wire will run on, built now so that the contract suite can be
/// pointed across a message boundary a phase before there is a server to point
/// it at — and so that the boundary is proven to be load-bearing before
/// anything depends on it.
///
/// ## Three decisions worth the words
///
/// **The payload is `DynamicValue.toJson()`, not the slim `WireValue` form.**
/// The slim encoding drops quality, source time and metadata — it is the hot
/// path, and Phase 3's session will use it, because on a 1500-key page the
/// metadata rides once in the subscribe result rather than on every push. Here
/// the lossless form is required by what the suite measures: the store
/// contract's unchanged-value case is decided by `==` on `DynamicValue`, and
/// `dynamic_value.dart:687` documents `fromJson(toJson())` as equal to the
/// original. A slim payload would make every re-delivery of an unchanged value
/// compare unequal on the client, and the k-of-n rebuild property would fail
/// against a source that was behaving perfectly.
///
/// **Levers arrive as notifications, not as requests.** Every member of
/// `StateManHarness` that this forwards returns `void`, so there is nothing for
/// a client to await and a request-shaped lever would invent an
/// acknowledgement the interface does not have. What makes a lever-then-request
/// sequence correct is instead the ordering guarantee of a single channel:
/// messages are delivered in the order they were sent, so a `setValue` posted
/// before a `readFresh` is applied before that read is answered. That is a
/// property of the transport, and it is the same property a WebSocket has, so
/// the sequence transfers to Phase 4 unchanged.
///
/// **Change detection is a listener per key, plus a re-scan.** A listener
/// attached to `api.listen(key)` catches every change to a key that already
/// exists — including the ones no lever caused, which is the point: the
/// freshness watchdog degrading a value to `badStale` is a change the client
/// must see, and nothing on the inbound path would ever tell it. A key that a
/// lever *creates* has no listener at the moment its first value lands, so
/// every inbound lever is followed by a re-scan of `api.keys` that adopts the
/// newcomers and marks them changed. The two mechanisms together are what makes
/// "every value the client holds arrived over this channel" true rather than
/// approximately true.
///
/// Coalescing is by microtask: changes accumulate in a set and one notification
/// carries all of them. A lever applies its whole batch synchronously, so the
/// batch is still one batch when the flush runs — which is what the
/// notification-count promise (`lib/src/harness.dart:56-61`) is made about.
