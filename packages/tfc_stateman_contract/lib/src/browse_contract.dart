/// The browse half of the contract: how an engineer finds a tag, and how the
/// page editor gets back to one it has already bound.
///
/// Browse is the surface the page editor binds widgets through. Everything else
/// in this suite is about a value that is already bound; this is about choosing
/// which value that is, which means an error here is not a wrong number on a
/// screen — it is a button wired to the wrong machine, discovered later, by
/// someone pressing it.
///
/// Four methods, and the fourth is the one that would have been forgotten.
/// `fetchRoots` / `fetchChildren` / `fetchDetail` are the obvious three: expand
/// a level at a time, because an eager tree of a real PLC address space is not
/// something to put on a slow link. `resolvePath` is the one RESEARCH found
/// already in the repo (`browse_panel.dart:67-79`) and the one the CONTEXT
/// default did not anticipate: opening the browse panel on an already-bound
/// value needs the root → … → leaf chain to pre-select it. Without it the panel
/// opens unpositioned and the engineer re-navigates a thousand-node tree by
/// hand to find the tag they were already looking at. That is a UX regression
/// that would be discovered late — after the pipe is the only way to browse —
/// so it gets a contract case now.
///
/// The ordering guarantee is the implementation's, not the decoder's. A list of
/// nodes crossing the wire carries no evidence of which end is the root, so
/// "ordered root → … → leaf, target last" cannot be enforced at the boundary;
/// it has to be a property of the source, which is to say a property this file
/// asserts. [checkResolvePathReturnsRootToLeafChain] walks the chain against
/// `fetchChildren` and proves each entry is genuinely the parent of the next —
/// a chain that merely *ends* at the right node, having invented the middle, is
/// still a tree the panel cannot expand.
///
/// Shape follows `write_contract.dart`: no implementation is imported, every
/// case is a named top-level function so the sabotage suite can run it against
/// a damaged source, every await is wrapped in [within] so silence fails by
/// name instead of hanging, and the one thing a case cannot discover for itself
/// — which ids exist in this source's address space — arrives as an injected
/// [BrowseFixture].
