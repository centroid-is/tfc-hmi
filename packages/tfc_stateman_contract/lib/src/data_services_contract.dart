/// Minimal round trips for the three data services: timeseries, history views
/// and preferences.
///
/// ## SCOPE BOUNDARY — read before adding a case here
///
/// **Behavior beyond round-tripping belongs to Phase 10 (DB-01..DB-04) and must
/// not be added to this file.** CONTEXT `<deferred>` defers deep timeseries,
/// history-view and preferences semantics deliberately: the interface methods
/// are frozen now so the wire surface can be closed (a method that does not
/// exist cannot be invoked by a client), but what the database does behind them
/// is a Phase 10 question and answering it here would freeze guesses as
/// contract.
///
/// What belongs here: the method exists, it carries its arguments, it returns
/// its declared type, and the value comes back. What does not: query planning,
/// downsampling *accuracy* (as opposed to the point count and the window),
/// retention behavior, bucket-boundary semantics, index selection, cross-client
/// preference propagation over a real pipe, and anything requiring a real
/// database to be true. Each of those is a real property and each has a Phase
/// 10 requirement waiting for it; asserting a weaker version of it here would
/// mean Phase 10 inherits a contract that is already almost right, which is
/// harder to correct than one that is honestly silent.
///
/// The one apparent exception is not one. [checkDownsampledRespectsMaxPoints]
/// asserts a bound and a span, not a sampling strategy: "no more than
/// `maxPoints` came back and they still reach both ends of the window" is a
/// shape promise every downsampler must keep, where "which points" is exactly
/// the Phase 10 question. It is here because an unbounded downsample is a
/// denial of service — a month of one-second samples is millions of points on
/// a link that exists to avoid exactly that.
///
/// ## Shape
///
/// Follows `write_contract.dart`: no implementation is imported, every case is
/// a named top-level function, every await is wrapped in [within] so silence
/// fails by name instead of hanging. Two of the three services can be seeded
/// through their own API — a history view is created by creating one, a
/// preference is set by setting one — which is why only timeseries needs a
/// harness: there is no `insert` on [TimeseriesApi] and there must not be, so
/// samples have to arrive from outside the wire surface.
