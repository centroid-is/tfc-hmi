/// Kernel traffic shaping: the faults that live below the byte stream.
///
/// `FaultProxy` owns everything expressible as "what bytes does the peer see,
/// and when". This file owns what is left: dropping an individual packet,
/// delivering it twice, delivering packet 7 before packet 6. Those are not
/// stream operations at all — a TCP connection reassembles in order by
/// definition, so a userspace proxy cannot inject reordering and cannot even
/// observe it. The kernel can, through `tc netem` on Linux and (unverified —
/// see the macOS section) `dnctl`/pf dummynet on macOS.
///
/// Nothing here is a test helper by accident. Two properties are load-bearing
/// and both are easy to lose in a refactor:
///
/// **Every command is an argument vector.** Each `…Argv` function returns a
/// `List<String>` that goes straight to [Process.run] with no shell in
/// between, and the interface name — the one value a caller supplies that ends
/// up next to `sudo` — is checked against [netemShapeableDevices] before it is
/// placed in that list. A device name must never be able to become a command
/// (threat T-02-14). The argv functions are public and pure precisely so a
/// test can assert on the exact vector without needing root.
///
/// **Teardown is registered the moment the install succeeds.** [installNetem]
/// takes a [TeardownRegistrar] — in a test, `addTearDown` itself — rather than
/// leaving removal to the end of the caller's body, because a body that throws
/// with `netem loss 100%` on `lo` leaves the whole machine unable to talk to
/// itself until somebody reboots or thinks to run `tc qdisc del` (threat
/// T-02-15). Passing the registrar in is also what keeps `package:test` out of
/// `lib/`.
///
/// Three measured facts from RESEARCH Finding 12 are encoded here rather than
/// left for each caller to rediscover:
///
/// 1. **netem shapes egress, and a loopback round trip crosses `lo`'s egress
///    twice.** `delay 50ms` measured a 108 ms RTT. The delay parameter is
///    therefore documented as *per traversal*, and [loopbackRoundTripFor] is
///    the single place the factor of two is written down.
/// 2. **`tc qdisc change` and `tc qdisc replace` preserve parameters that the
///    new command does not mention.** Verified: after a `rate 1mbit`, a
///    `replace … delay 7ms` still had the rate attached. So setup is `del`
///    (tolerating "nothing was installed") then `add`, always. Neither keyword
///    appears in this file, and a test greps for that.
/// 3. **`tc qdisc del` with nothing installed exits 2.** [removeNetem]
///    tolerates exactly that code and no other, which is what makes an
///    unconditional teardown safe without making a genuine failure silent.
///
/// Bandwidth throttling is deliberately absent even though netem can do it:
/// the proxy already throttles at the stream layer, and a `rate` here is the
/// parameter RESEARCH watched leak between tests. This file is for the faults
/// that have nowhere else to live.
