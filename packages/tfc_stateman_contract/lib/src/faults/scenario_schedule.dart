/// A seeded fault storm: generated as pure data, played back against a proxy.
///
/// `[CITED: relay-websocket-notes.md §7.8]` fixes the requirement — *"failure
/// reproduction is `(seed, schedule log)` — same seed, same run"* — and
/// specifies the generator: random mode changes drawn from {flap, latency,
/// throttle, blackhole, clean} every 1–10 s for 30+ minutes.
///
/// **The determinism requirement is stricter than "use a seeded `Random`".**
/// Nothing that influences *which* fault happens or *when* may read a clock.
/// So the whole timeline is generated up front: [ScenarioSchedule.generate] is
/// a pure function from `(seed, duration, weights)` to an immutable
/// `List<ScheduledFault>`, and [ScenarioPlayback] is the only part that touches
/// time. Two things fall out of that split, and both are the reason for it:
/// generation is unit-testable with plain equality rather than with a fake
/// clock, and the generated list **is** the schedule log, so a failing soak
/// prints its own reproduction procedure with no separate recording mechanism.
///
/// This is the repo's established shape rather than a new one:
/// `packages/tfc_relay_protocol/lib/src/send_buffer.dart` states the same
/// pure-decision-core / timed-edge split in its library doc and enforces it by
/// making `poll(int nowMs)` take the clock as an argument. [FaultMutation]
/// mirrors that file's sealed-verdict shape for the same reason it has one — a
/// sealed base with one final class per lever makes [ScenarioPlayback.apply]
/// exhaustive, so a ninth mutation added without teaching playback about it is
/// a compile error rather than a lever that silently never fires.
///
/// **Seeded, and deliberately so.**
/// `packages/tfc_relay_protocol/lib/src/ulid.dart:17-21` insists on
/// [Random.secure] and explains why: a predictable write id lets a hostile
/// client re-query another operator's write outcome. This file insists on the
/// opposite, and names that one so the divergence reads as a decision rather
/// than as an oversight — a storm nobody can replay is a storm whose failures
/// cannot be fixed, and there is no attacker here to keep in the dark.
///
/// It goes one step further than `Random(seed)`, because the SDK's own seeded
/// generator documents that *"the implementation of the random stream can
/// change between releases"*. A repro log that stops reproducing after a Dart
/// upgrade is not a repro log — Phase 11's soak failures will be reproduced
/// weeks later, on a machine that has been updated in the meantime. So
/// [SeededScenarioRandom] is a `Random` this file owns and pins: same seed,
/// same stream, for as long as this source file says what it says.
///
/// **The generator consults the proxy's exclusion table.** `exclusiveModePairs`
/// is refused at set time, synchronously, by the lever being pulled — which
/// during a 30-minute soak means the storm aborting the run it was generated
/// to test. So the conflict is resolved during generation, deterministically
/// and inside the pure function: an arming draw emits explicit clears for every
/// incumbent it excludes, at the same offset, immediately before itself.
