/// The store half of the contract: what an arriving batch is allowed to cost.
///
/// Cases come from one measured scenario, recorded in CONTEXT D-01 and pinned
/// as CLI-06: **1500 keys on one page over a slow connection**. The rejected
/// design — one broadcast stream per key — pays an event per key per update and
/// wakes every widget whether its value moved or not. The chosen design applies
/// a batch in one synchronous loop over a single map and notifies only where
/// the value genuinely changed, so k changed keys cost k rebuilds rather than
/// n.
///
/// That is a promise about a *count*, and a count is only enforceable if
/// something counts it. These three cases are that something. They are what
/// stops an implementation from being correct and unusable at the same time: a
/// source that delivers every right value and rebuilds the world on every tick
/// passes every case in `subscribe_contract.dart` and turns a mimic into a
/// slideshow.
///
/// As with every file in this suite, no implementation is imported — the
/// factory passed to [runStoreContract] is the only coupling — and every await
/// is wrapped in [within] so silence fails fast and by name.
