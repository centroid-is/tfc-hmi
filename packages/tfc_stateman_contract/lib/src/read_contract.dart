/// The read half of the contract: what asking for a value costs, and what
/// "not known" is allowed to look like.
///
/// Three reads exist on the interface and CONTEXT D-03 splits them by cost:
/// [StateManApi.read] is synchronous and answers from the cache (the
/// `DeviceClient.read` convention, `state_man.dart:861-891`),
/// [StateManApi.readFresh] forces a round trip for diagnostics and readback
/// checks, and [StateManApi.readMany] answers many keys in one. The split is
/// only worth having if the costs are real, so the cases here are about
/// arithmetic as much as about values: ten cached reads must cost nothing, one
/// forced read must cost exactly one round trip, and fifty keys must cost one
/// round trip rather than fifty. N round trips over a link with 200 ms of
/// latency is the failure mode `state_man_api.dart` names as the reason this
/// project exists.
///
/// The other half is the null convention. `read` returning null means "nothing
/// is known yet", which is a different fact from "known to be zero" and a
/// different fact again from "known to be bad". A widget that cannot tell them
/// apart draws a plausible reading for a tag that may not exist.
///
/// Shape follows `subscribe_contract.dart`: no implementation is imported, the
/// factory passed to [runReadContract] is the only coupling to one, every case
/// is a named top-level function so `test/sabotage_freshness_test.dart` can run
/// it against a damaged implementation, and every await is wrapped in [within]
/// so silence fails by name instead of hanging to the runner's timeout.
