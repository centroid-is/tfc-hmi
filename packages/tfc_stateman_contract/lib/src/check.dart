///
/// The indirect one: the check **caught** the transport error itself and failed

/// their property is "an unresolvable target degrades to null rather than
/// throwing", so *any* throw is the failure they are built to report, and they
/// report it in operator language with the original error quoted inside. That
/// is right, and it means the only evidence left is the text. Matching
/// [methodNotFoundCode] in it is precise enough to be worth doing: the number
/// is fixed by the JSON-RPC specification, it is not a value any of these
/// checks would otherwise mention, and the alternative is excusing those cases
/// with no evidence at all.
///
/// **On a word boundary, not anywhere in the string** (04-REVIEW IN-03). A
/// bare `contains` excused a check that failed for a completely different
/// reason as long as the digits turned up somewhere in the message — inside a
/// nested `data` echo of the request, inside a larger number, inside a
