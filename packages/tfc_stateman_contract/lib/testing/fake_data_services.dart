/// What must survive that replacement is the contract, not this code — so
/// nothing here should grow a behavior the contract does not ask for, because
/// a behavior nobody wrote a case for is one the database will silently fail to

///
/// They live under `lib/testing/` for the same reason `fake_state_man.dart`
