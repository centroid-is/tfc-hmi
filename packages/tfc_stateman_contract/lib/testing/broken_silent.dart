/// The implementation that imitates a link which is up but dead.
///
/// Every other variant under `lib/testing/` breaks one behaviour and inherits
/// the rest, so a sabotage suite can assert that the targeted check fails and
/// its neighbours still pass. This one is the opposite by design: it breaks
/// *everything*, and it is not there to be caught by a particular check. It is
/// there to be pointed at **every** check at once.
///
/// What it stands for is the worst thing a transport can do, which is nothing.
/// A socket whose TCP connection is still open while the process behind it is
/// wedged; an OPC UA session that acknowledges a subscription and never
/// publishes; a database that accepts a query and never answers. Nothing errors,
/// nothing closes, nothing arrives.
///
/// Against a source like this, a check that awaits without a deadline does not
/// fail — it **hangs**, for the full 30-second `package:test` timeout, on every
/// CI run for as long as the case exists, and then reports the name of a test
/// file instead of the property an operator lost. That is the cost
/// [within] exists to prevent, and `test/suite_integrity_test.dart` runs every
/// registered check against this class to prove no check in the suite can incur
/// it.
///
/// Note the one thing it does *not* do: it never throws. A variant that threw
/// would be caught by any check that awaits anything, which would make the
/// sweep pass without saying anything about deadlines. Silence is the only
/// sabotage that distinguishes a check with a budget from a check without one.
