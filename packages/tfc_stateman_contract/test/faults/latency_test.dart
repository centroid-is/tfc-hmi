///
/// | Configured per direction | RTT min / avg / max | Ideal RTT |
/// |---|---|---|
/// | 50 ms  | 102 / 104.8 / 109 ms  | 100 ms  |
/// | 200 ms | 404 / 404.7 / 405 ms  | 400 ms  |
/// | 500 ms | 1004 / 1004.6 / 1005 ms | 1000 ms |
///
/// The overhead is a small constant — 1 to 2.5 ms per direction — and not a
/// proportion of the configured delay. That is the whole reason every timing
/// assertion in this file is `inInclusiveRange(2 * d, 2 * d + _slack)` and never
/// a proportional band: a band of one twentieth is 5 ms at 50 ms, which is
/// tighter than the measured overhead and fails on a good day, and 25 ms at
/// 500 ms, which is looser than the overhead and would pass a mode that had
/// quietly stopped injecting anything. The slack is widened from the measured
/// 4-9 ms to 20 ms for CI hardware (Assumption A5), and it is the same slack
/// at both delays on purpose. It is 75 ms rather than 20 off Linux, where the
/// runners are shared and noisy — see [_slack] for why that is a statement
/// about the hardware and not a loosened assertion.
///
/// **What this mode is for.** Phase 7's F19 and F20 are slow-link scenarios;
/// their precondition is a proxy that can add a known one-way delay to a live
/// connection without disturbing anything else about it. So this file asserts
/// two things that are easy to forget in a timing test: that the delayed bytes
/// still all arrive, in order, and that setting the lever on an *already open*
/// connection changes that connection. A latency mode that only works when set
/// before connect cannot express "the link degrades at minute three", which is
/// the shape every one of those scenarios takes.
