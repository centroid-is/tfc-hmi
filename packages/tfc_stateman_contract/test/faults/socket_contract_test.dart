/// The contract, judged over a real TCP socket, through the fault proxy.
///
/// The channel harness proves the contract survives a message boundary. It does
/// not prove the contract survives a *network*: a `StreamChannelController`
/// delivers on a microtask, never fragments a message, never reorders a close
/// against the data in front of it, and cannot be blackholed. Everything the
/// fault kit exists to inject needs a descriptor to inject it into.
///
/// So this file runs the same sub-suites the channel harness runs, against the
/// same client, over a loopback socket that goes through a [FaultProxy]. Four
/// separate claims, one group each:
///
///  * **Framing.** A JSON message split across two TCP segments arrives whole.
///    This is the one property the channel harness could never have tested,
///    because a controller has no segments.
///  * **The contract.** Subscribe, read and write, unmodified, through the
///    socket leg with the proxy passing traffic through.
///  * **The bite.** With `blackhole()` pulled, named value-path checks fail —
///    the socket leg's answer to `channel_bite_test.dart`'s severed channel. A
///    harness that quietly handed back a local object would pass the group
///    above and fail here, which is the only reason the group above is worth
///    anything.
///  * **Hygiene.** Twenty build/teardown cycles of the whole harness leave the
///    process's open-socket count where they found it. 02-02 established the
///    criterion against the bare proxy; a harness that stacks a server socket
///    and two peers on top of each proxied pair is where it actually gets
///    tested.
