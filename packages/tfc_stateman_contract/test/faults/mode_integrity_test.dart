/// Properties of the *fault suite as a whole*, which no mode test can assert
/// about itself.
///
/// **No mode without a proof, no proof without a mode.** `faultModes` names
/// eight modes and the roadmap claims each one has a test proving it does what
/// it says. That claim is a property of the suite, so it is asserted here in
/// both directions, for the reason `test/suite_integrity_test.dart:22-28` gives
/// about orphaned checks: the two failures are different and both are silent. A
/// mode nobody exercises is a fault nobody is testing, sitting in the
/// repository looking like coverage. A proof file exercising a mode that
/// `faultModes` no longer declares is a case that will never be reached from
/// the registry every other sweep iterates.
///
/// **How the proof files are discovered, and why the choice matters.** By
/// reading `test/faults/` and asking of each file *which levers does its source
/// pull* — not by matching a filename convention. Convention would be a lie
/// here: `bufferServerToClient` is proved by `buffer_test.dart`, so a
/// snake-case rule would report a missing proof for a mode that has one, and
/// whoever fixed that would fix it by loosening the rule. Lever discovery also
/// makes the reverse direction real: a file keeps proving a mode only while
/// that mode is still declared, so a name dropped from `faultModes` while its
/// lever survives is caught here rather than at the next rename.
///
/// A discovery mechanism that silently matches nothing passes vacuously, which
/// is the exact failure this file exists to prevent — so [_proofFiles] is
/// asserted non-empty and at least as large as the mode count, every exempt
/// filename is asserted to name a file that still exists, and one case points
/// the discovery at an empty directory and asserts it reports zero. That last
/// arm is the falsification: without it, "every mode has a proof" would keep
/// passing after somebody moved the directory.
///
/// **The corruption catalogue and the exclusion table** are swept the same way,
/// one level up. Both `malformed_peer_test.dart` and `composition_test.dart`
/// already derive their case counts *from* their registries, so the sweep that
/// matters from outside is: the owning test file still enumerates the registry
/// (rather than having drifted into a hand-written list beside it), and the
/// registry is still the size this phase claims. A corruption deleted from the
/// catalogue takes its case with it and no in-file count notices.
///
/// **The wall-clock budget.** The fault lane is slower than the contract suite
/// *by design* — throttle measures a rate over three-and-a-half-second windows
/// and flap needs a whole flap window, and neither can be hurried without
/// measuring the scheduler instead of the proxy. The budget exists so that
/// "slower by design" cannot drift into "nobody runs it". Measuring the lane
/// means running it, which costs the lane's whole runtime again, so the
/// measurement is opt-in behind [_laneBudgetEnvVar]: on by name in CI, off
/// locally, and skipped by name on the run report when off, never silently.
/// Turning it on unconditionally would make this file the denial of service it
/// is here to prevent. The file's own sweep is timed and printed on every run.
