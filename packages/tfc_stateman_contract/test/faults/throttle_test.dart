/// The throttle, measured in bytes per second — roadmap criterion 2's own

/// RESEARCH Finding 5 measured a token bucket against a firehose sender, with
/// the timing started at the first delivered byte:
///
/// | Target | Window | Measured |
/// |---|---|---|
/// | 1000 kbit/s | 3 s | 1002.3 kbit/s |
/// | 1000 kbit/s | 6 s | 1001.0 kbit/s |
/// | 100 kbit/s  | 3 s | 100.0 kbit/s  |
/// | 100 kbit/s  | 6 s | 100.2 kbit/s  |
/// | 10 kbit/s   | 3 s | 10.0 kbit/s   |
///
/// So the mechanism is accurate to a fifth of a per cent, and the band here is
/// a full twentieth (Assumption A5: CI hardware is slower and noisier than the
/// machine that table came from). The window is never shorter than three
/// seconds, because the bucket's one-second burst cap dominates anything below
/// about two.
///
/// **The two rates are not arbitrary.** They are the ones Phase 7's F19 and
/// F20 name — 1 Mbit/s and 100 kbit/s — and those scenarios assert against
/// this mode directly. A throttle that does not actually throttle turns their
/// conflation evidence into a coincidence: "the client kept up under a slow
/// link" is only interesting if the link was slow.
///
/// **Wall-clock by design, and budgeted.** Two measurement windows plus a
/// pressure window plus an integrity run is about fifteen seconds, and the
/// file is meant to stay under twenty-five. Plan 02-14 budgets the whole fault
/// suite, and this file is the largest single line item in it; anything added
