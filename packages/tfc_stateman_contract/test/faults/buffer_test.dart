/// over from `tfc_dart/test/proxy.dart:118-154` (02-PATTERNS Keep #2). The
/// reason is the non-obvious part: forwarding the client's bytes keeps the
/// server-side conversation alive, so the upstream peer goes on receiving,
/// answering and not timing out while every one of its answers is held back.
/// A symmetric hold would be `blackhole`, and the scenarios that need this one
/// need a server that is demonstrably fine and a client that is nonetheless
/// hearing nothing.
///
/// **Withhold, not discard.** The bytes are still owed. `flush()` releases
/// them, in order and complete, and so does turning the lever off — which is
/// the whole difference from `blackhole`, where they are gone. `flush()`
/// deliberately leaves the lever armed, as the original `flushBuffer()` did:
/// releasing a batch and continuing to withhold is what a store-and-forward
/// stall looks like, and a flush that disarmed could not express it.
///
/// **The bounded arm is the one that keeps this mode honest.** Plan 02-02
/// removed an unbounded queue that took a host from 163 MB to 4463 MB of RSS
/// in four seconds (RESEARCH Finding 7), and a withhold lever is the most
/// natural way to put it straight back — a second buffer, off to the side,
/// outside the high-water mark. So the withheld bytes live in the same
/// `DelayLine` queue as everything else and count toward the same
/// `pendingBytes`, and the arm below firehoses into a withheld direction for
/// four seconds to prove the pause still engages.
