/// connection ends, `throttle` means the same bytes arrive more slowly. None
/// of those sentences can be judged against a transport that reorders,
/// truncates or stalls on its own. So this file asserts the boring half
/// first: a client that connects through the proxy reaches the server, in
/// both directions, with a payload large enough to cross the delay line's
/// high-water mark and come back intact.
///
/// It also asserts the two things that make the *unfinished* proxy honest.
/// Every one of the eight modes named in `faultModes` has its lever declared
/// today, and setting one whose behaviour has not landed throws by name.
/// A lever that silently did nothing would let a mode test pass against a
/// proxy that never injected the fault — the failure that makes a mode look
/// tested, and the one 02-14's integrity sweep exists to catch phase-wide.
