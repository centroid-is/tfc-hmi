/// One genuine reset, observed at the peer, and normal service afterwards.
///
/// **The contrast with `cutMidFrame` is the reason both modes exist.** That one
/// cuts with a FIN so the bytes already delivered survive; this one cuts with
/// `SO_LINGER{1, 0}` followed by `destroy()` so they do not. RESEARCH Finding 2
/// measured that pair producing a real RST in 50 of 50 runs, and Finding 1
/// measured plain `destroy()` producing a clean FIN in every state but one — a
/// peer with data still unread in the kernel queue, which is a coincidence of
/// timing and not something a mode can be built on. So the two modes are built
/// on two primitives, and each of these files fails when its mode is
/// reimplemented with the other's (both sabotage runs are recorded in the
/// plan's SUMMARY).
///
/// **Why a half-open scenario needs the reset specifically.** A FIN tells the
/// peer the connection is over; the client's `onDone` fires and its reconnect
/// logic runs. A reset is what a crashed peer, a NAT timeout or a yanked cable
/// produce, and the client-side code paths are different — which is what Phase
/// 3 and Phase 4 exercise through this lever. A `killOnce` that degraded to a
/// FIN would run those scenarios against an orderly shutdown and report them
/// green.
///
/// **The error is caught as `Object`.** Finding 9: `Socket.connect` against a
/// resetting listener throws a bare [OSError], which is not a subtype of
/// [SocketException]. A clause narrowed to [SocketException] does not catch it,
/// so the suite crashes at the moment it meant to report — the errno comes out
/// through `errnoOf` instead, and its value is never asserted because it is a
/// platform's business which number means "reset".
///
/// **The reset assertions are gated on a runtime probe**, never on
/// `Platform.isWindows` (Assumptions Log A3): whether this kernel accepts the
/// 8-byte `struct linger` is a question the kernel answers, and `setRawOption`
/// rejects a wrong-size struct loudly. The surgical half — that the connection
/// after the killed one is forwarded end to end — is ungated, because it holds
/// whichever way the cut was made.
