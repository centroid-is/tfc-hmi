/// Every corruption in the catalogue, applied to a real `json_rpc_2` peer, and
/// asserted against the outcome RESEARCH *measured* rather than the outcome
/// intuition predicts.
///
/// The measurement is the whole point of this file. Nine of the thirteen
/// entries leave the pending request unsettled forever and four resolve, and
/// which is which is not inferable from the corruption: a `result` typed as a
/// String resolves, while an `id` typed as a Map hangs; `1e999` resolves (as
/// `Infinity`, in application code); an 8 MiB frame resolves in full. A
/// catalogue whose entries were only described would be a catalogue every
/// reader had to re-derive, and the derivation is wrong.
///
/// Two rules the assertions follow, both from `lib/src/meta.dart:60-79`:
///
///  * **Never `throwsA`.** The Peer does not throw on a malformed response —
///    it replies `-32700` to the sender and carries on with the client half
///    never told anything failed (RESEARCH Finding 15). A `throwsA` here would
///    hang for the runner's thirty seconds and then report this file's name
///    instead of the property. The hang is asserted by converting a deadline
///    into a plain bool and asserting on the bool, which does produce a
///    `TestFailure` carrying its reason.
///  * **Every budget is short and named**, so silence fails fast. Nine hang
///    cases in one file is only affordable because each of them costs its
///    budget and not the runner's timeout, and the file's own runtime is
///    asserted at the end as evidence that they do.
///
/// Every case also asserts the two things that make the failure *quiet* rather
/// than loud: the Peer is still open afterwards, and a subsequent valid request
/// still gets an answer. A malformed frame does not take the link down. It
/// takes one request down, invisibly, and leaves the link looking healthy.
