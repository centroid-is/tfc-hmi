/// The whole contract suite, against an implementation on the far side of a
/// channel.
///
/// The first half of roadmap criterion 3, and the file the phase is for. Every
/// other driver in `test/channel/` judges one sub-suite; this one points
/// `runStateManContract` — the entry point a real implementation will use — at
/// a `FakeStateMan` reachable only through a `StreamChannelController`, with
/// every capability declared, and asserts that the number of cases that ran is
/// the number the registry has.
///
/// ## Why the count is the assertion
///
/// A harness has one cheap way to look green, and it is not a bug in any file:
/// declare a capability `false`. The run stays honest-looking — the report even
/// says the capability was skipped rather than passed — and the property goes
/// unjudged for every implementation that follows. `supportsDataServices:
/// false` here would delete seven cases and nothing would complain, which is
/// the move this file exists to make impossible (T-02-23).
///
/// So two numbers are checked, and they come from different places on purpose:
///
///  * `contractCasesRegistered`'s delta is what `runStateManContract` says it
///    registered to run, under the flags it was given. It catches a flag left
///    false.
///  * `ran` is what the test runner actually started, counted by a `setUp` in
///    the enclosing group. It catches a case registered and then skipped, which
///    the first number cannot see.
///
/// Both are compared against `allContractChecks.length`: not against a literal,
/// because a literal is a number somebody updates to match, and the thing being
/// asserted is precisely that nobody had to.
