/// CR-01, end to end: a write whose result is truncated on the wire never
/// settles.
///
/// The Phase 1 review cycle queued this case as "a truncated write result must
/// surface as an unknown outcome, never a throw". The measured failure is worse
/// than that and much quieter: `json_rpc_2.Peer` does not fail the pending
/// request at all. It replies `-32700` to the sender, stays open, keeps
/// answering everything else, and leaves `ChannelStateMan.write`'s future
/// pending forever (RESEARCH Finding 15). So there is no throw to convert into
/// an unknown, and no event anywhere for a caller to notice.
///
/// What that is, on a plant: an operator presses start, the outcome never
/// arrives, and the write box sits there. Nothing has failed — nothing has been
/// reported at all — so the operator presses it again, on a machine that may
/// already have moved. That is the write-safety property in `CLAUDE.md` losing
/// to silence rather than to a retry.
///
/// **This file is the counterpart to a fix that does not exist yet.** Phase 4's
/// `RemoteStateMan` per-request deadline is what turns this hang into an honest
/// `WriteUnknown`, and when it lands, this file's polarity flips: the hang
/// assertions below become "resolves, as unknown, inside the deadline". The
/// deadline deliberately does **not** live in `ChannelStateMan`
/// (`channel_state_man.dart:193-206` says so at the call site) — inventing one
/// here would hide the thing this file exists to show.
///
/// Assertion mechanism, from `lib/src/meta.dart:60-79` with the polarity
/// inverted: await into a plain bool through `onTimeout`, then assert on the
/// bool. A completes-matcher or a throws-matcher would let the deadline escape
/// as a raw `TimeoutException` — the undiagnosable failure that idiom exists to
/// forbid — and the runner would report this file's name rather than the write
/// an operator lost. Both are grep-enforced and therefore not named in prose.
