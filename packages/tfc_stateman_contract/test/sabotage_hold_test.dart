/// Proof that the hold-to-run checks bite.
///
/// Every case here runs a real contract check against an implementation that
/// is wrong in one specific way, and asserts the check noticed —
/// [expectContractViolation] holding it to all three clauses: it must not
/// hang, it must not pass, and it must report through `expect`/`fail` so the
/// message names the property an operator lost rather than a stack frame.
///
/// This file is where WRT-04 stops being a claim. A deadman is the one control
/// on a plant whose failure mode is *nothing happening* — a counter that keeps
/// advancing looks exactly like a counter that is being fed, and a hold that
/// never stops looks exactly like an operator with their finger down. Five
/// checks that all passed a source which quietly kept a machine running would
/// be five checks nobody could tell from coverage.
///
/// The surgical cases matter as much as the violation cases. A variant that
/// failed every check would prove nothing about any individual one; asserting
/// that each variant still passes a named neighbour is what pins the failure to
/// the property under test. Two of the five are *broad* by construction —
/// break the feed and every case that ticks as an anti-vacuity arm goes with
/// it — and each of those says so at its own case, with the neighbour it does
/// still pass named.
