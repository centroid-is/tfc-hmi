/// The whole contract, in one call, against the reference implementation.

/// This is the phase gate: ROADMAP criteria 2 and 3 are that the suite "runs
/// against an arbitrary `StateManApi` instance passed in as a parameter" and
/// "passes against a fake/reference in-memory implementation", and both are
/// statements about the suite as a single artifact rather than about any
/// slice of it. The four per-slice drivers stay where they are — they are the
/// fast feedback while a slice is being worked on — but this file is what says
/// the contract is whole.
///
/// It registers the suite twice, and the second registration is not a
/// duplicate. The first declares every capability and is the accounting run:
/// the cases it runs must be exactly [allContractChecks], or something was
/// dropped. The second declares a source that takes no writes and has no
/// database behind it, browsing a different address space — the shape of a
/// panel talking to a gateway deployed without TimescaleDB — and it exists to
/// prove the capability flags are load-bearing rather than decorative. Three
/// separate ways they could be decorative are ruled out here:
///
///  * a boolean that changes nothing: the second run must execute strictly
///    fewer cases, and exactly as many fewer as the two declined registries
///    hold;
///  * a hook the umbrella declares and never forwards: every hook passed in
///    counts its own calls, and the last group asserts each was reached, so a
///    forwarding line deleted from the umbrella fails here rather than being
///    discovered when `RemoteStateMan` needs it in Phase 4;
///  * a fixture the umbrella defaults instead of forwarding: the second run's
///    source serves a tree the *default* fixture does not describe, so a
///    dropped `browseFixture` makes six browse cases fail rather than pass
///    against landmarks nobody chose.
