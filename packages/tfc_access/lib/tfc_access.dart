/// The fixed access vocabulary shared by the HMI and, later, the relay.

/// Groups, roles, the authenticated user, the authentication interface, the

/// and the HMI's key derivation: Argon2id for passwords, PBKDF2 for
/// config-export envelopes and for every password hash written before Argon2id
/// landed, governed by one test cost hook between them. This library
/// is pure Dart and must stay that way; see the README for the one-way
/// dependency rule and `test/package_purity_test.dart` for its enforcement.
