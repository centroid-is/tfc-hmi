/// One row of the audit trail.
///
/// The field list mirrors the `AuditEntry` table in spec §2 **one for one**, in
/// column order. Plan 01-05 maps them straight across into the Drift row with
/// no translation layer, precisely so there is nothing in between to drift out
/// of sync when a column is added.
///
/// ## The auth surface
///
/// Spec §2 enumerates `surface` as `'tag' | 'pref' | 'route'` — the three
/// *write* surfaces. Phase 1 has no writes to audit; its done-condition is that
/// login, logout and failed attempts land in the table. So `'auth'` is a fourth
/// surface value, with its own itemKey vocabulary:
///
///     login | login.failed | logout | session.timeout
///
/// and an **empty** [groupRequired], because signing in is not gated on a
/// group. The named constructors below are what fix that vocabulary, so no
/// consumer has to invent column values and the Phase 5 trail viewer has
/// something exact to filter on.
///
/// ## The admin surface
///
/// Phase 6 adds a fifth surface, `'admin'`, for the writes the roles and users
/// screens make. A role edit that grants somebody `force` and leaves no trace
/// is the widest gap this product could ship with — re-scoping a role is the
/// most consequential hand-made write in it. The itemKey vocabulary is eight
/// strings:
///
///     role.create | role.update | role.delete | role.rename
///     user.create | user.delete | user.role   | user.password
///
/// Three things differ from the auth four, each on purpose:
///
/// 1. [groupRequired] is `AccessGroup.users.name`, not empty. Signing in is not
///    gated; editing a role is. That one field is also what puts these rows
///    behind the trail viewer's existing `users` filter chip with no change to
///    the viewer — a row carrying an empty [groupRequired] would fall outside
///    every group filter instead.
/// 2. [allowed] is a **parameter** on all eight. Each auth constructor *is* an
///    outcome and can hardcode it; an admin action can be refused by the `users`
///    gate, and a refused role edit is a row worth having. Allow-only
///    constructors would leave the store hand-building denial rows, which is the
///    vocabulary drifting on day one.
/// 3. [oldValue] and [newValue] carry group sets encoded the one way this
///    codebase encodes them, `AccessRole.encodeGroups()` — a JSON array in
///    [AccessGroup.values] order — so `["operate"] -> ["operate","force"]` is
///    legible in the viewer's generic old-to-new row.
///
/// **The account or role acted upon goes in [member], never in [itemKey].** The
/// itemKey vocabulary is a closed set of eight strings the viewer filters on;
/// folding the subject in (`user.role.jon`) would make it unbounded, and an
/// unbounded itemKey is an unfilterable one. The viewer already renders
/// [itemKey] with its [member] suffix, so `user.role` on member `jon` reads
/// correctly with no change there.
///
/// `'admin'` is a private literal on this class, **not** a fourth
/// `AccessSurface` value. `AccessSurface` is the type the policy answers
/// questions about, and nothing ever gates on an admin row; adding it there
/// would make `AccessSurface.byWireName` claim a surface the policy never
/// consults. `'auth'` set that precedent and this follows it exactly.
///
/// ## What must not be in here
///
/// No auth constructor takes a password, a hash or a salt, and none ever
/// should. [toString] withholds [oldValue] and [newValue] for auth rows for the
/// same reason — a trail that leaks credentials is worse than no trail.
///
/// That extends to the admin surface, where two constructors are where somebody
/// will be tempted: [AuditRecord.userPassword] and [AuditRecord.userCreate].
/// Neither takes a password, a hash or a salt, and [AuditRecord.userPassword]
/// leaves both value columns null. Note the hazard: [toString]'s withholding is
/// keyed on [isAuthEvent], i.e. `surface == 'auth'`, so an admin row's values
/// are **not** withheld from logs. That is correct for a group set, and it is
/// exactly why those two constructors have no parameter that could carry a
/// credential, rather than relying on callers to pass none.
