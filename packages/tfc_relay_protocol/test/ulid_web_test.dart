/// The ULID's 48-bit time prefix, checked on a **32-bit-bitwise** backend.
///
/// These cases pass on the VM whatever the implementation does, and that is the
/// point of the file: every one of them was green on the VM while `newUlid()`
/// was silently wrong under `dart2js`, because JavaScript's bitwise operators
/// coerce to **signed 32 bits** and the timestamp field is 48. Run them with
/// `-p chrome` (dart2js) and nothing else — see the compile-target note below.
///
/// **`dart2wasm` cannot substitute for this.** Wasm has true 64-bit integers
/// and produces the correct id, so a Wasm smoke test — which is what
/// `relay-comm-design.md` §8 originally scheduled — passes while the defect
/// ships. `flutter build web` emits dart2js, and `dart test -p chrome` uses
/// dart2js, so dart2js is the only backend that both matters and reproduces it.
///
/// What was actually wrong, measured on the real package before the fix:
///
/// ```text
/// VM      : 01M16HNP00E3SJHFRAN1K5PYMS
/// dart2js : 00016HNP000JJQTTA2X8HTGWGQ
/// ```
///
/// Uniqueness survived — the 80-bit suffix is drawn from `Random.secure()` and
/// never touches a shift — so nothing would have collided. What did not survive
/// is the **time-sortability the file calls load-bearing**: two mints 2^32 ms
/// (49.7 days) apart produced an identical prefix, and every browser-minted id
/// would have sorted before every native one for ever.
