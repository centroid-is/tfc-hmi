/// The four TLS failure paths, driven through the fault proxy the rest of this
/// package already uses — so Phase 7's F1–F21 gate inherits them built rather
/// than discovering them under a deadline.
///
/// **Nothing in the proxy had to change, and that is the finding.** `FaultProxy`
/// is a loopback *byte* relay (`fault_proxy.dart:141-190`): it forwards through
/// a `DelayLine` and never looks at a frame, so ciphertext passes through
/// opaquely and `latency`, `throttle`, `flap`, `blackhole`, `killOnce` and
/// `reject` keep their meanings exactly (06-RESEARCH §C.4's mode table). The
/// only requirement is on the certificate: the panel dials
/// `wss://127.0.0.1:<proxy port>`, so the leaf's SAN has to cover `127.0.0.1`
/// as an `iPAddress` — which is what 06-01's `0x87` fix makes possible and what
/// `mintLeaf`'s default SANs already carry.
///
/// **One mode does change meaning, and the last group here measures it rather
/// than fixing it.** `cutMidFrame(n)` counts wire bytes
/// (`delay_line.dart:297,476,554`); under TLS those are ciphertext bytes, so a
/// cut lands inside a TLS record and the WebSocket layer never sees half an
/// application frame. See that group's own doc, and `fault_fixture.dart`'s
/// paragraph on which modes survive the change of layer.
///
/// **Every dial here is bounded.** An unreachable address costs 75 s on macOS
/// (06-RESEARCH §C.4, trap 17), and a blackholed *handshake* costs longer than
/// that — it never resolves at all, because the TCP connect succeeded and it is
/// the TLS handshake that is being swallowed. The direct probes pass
/// `connectTimeout:` to [connect]; every panel is built on a `ClientConfig`
/// whose `connectTimeout` is set, which is what bounds the dials the supervisor
/// makes for itself.
///
/// **No arm asserts *why* a handshake failed.** Trap 16: wrong CA, expired leaf
/// and wrong hostname produce byte-identical text. What names the cause is how
/// the arm is built — one input changed against a fixture that otherwise
/// connects — and the case name says which input.
///
/// **Every failure arm ends in a recovery.** A failure path that cannot be
/// recovered from is half a test, and recovery is what Phase 7's gate actually
/// asserts: the value the plant changed *during* the outage has to arrive after
/// it, which is the difference between a panel that reconnected and a panel
/// that re-rendered what it already had.
///
/// Without this file, Phase 7 discovers on the day of the gate that a TLS leg
/// through the proxy either does not stand up or stalls the lane for 75 s a
/// case — and the plant-side property nobody would then have measured is the
/// one that matters: a panel whose gateway certificate is wrong must keep
/// trying and must come back by itself the moment somebody replaces the file.
