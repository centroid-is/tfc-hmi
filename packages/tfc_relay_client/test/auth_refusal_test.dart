/// A credential the gateway refused stops the redial loop, and the refusal an
/// operator reads never repeats the credential back.
///
/// Source: 06-CONTEXT amendment 4 and 06-RESEARCH §C.6. Before this file, a
/// `-32003 unauthorized` on `hello` fell through to `_down` — which re-arms the
/// barrier and calls `_schedule()`. The gateway says the same thing about it
/// from the other end (`error_codes.dart:31-34`): "reconnecting with the same
/// token will be refused again, so a backoff loop around it is a busy loop."
///
/// **What breaks in the plant without this file.** An integrator mistypes one
/// character of a station token during a commissioning weekend. The panel dials,
/// is refused, waits out a capped backoff and dials again — one rejected hello
/// every thirty seconds, from that panel, forever, against the one process that
/// is also serving every other screen in the factory. Nothing on the panel says
/// why: the screen is grey and the link indicator says "connecting", which is
/// the same thing it says for a pulled cable, so the first person called is the
/// network electrician and not the person holding the token file. With the arm,
/// the panel is refused once and says so in a sentence naming the credential.
///
/// **Why the number is a local constant.** The client cannot import the
/// server's `ServerErrorCodes` — that package is a dev dependency here, and
/// `connection_supervisor.dart:92-98` forbids a production file reaching into
/// one. So `-32003` is declared in the supervisor and pinned by this file
/// driving it verbatim against a scripted gateway, exactly as
/// `reconnect_test.dart` pins `-32004`.
///
/// **The two arms are deliberately independent.** `a version refusal still
/// stops the loop` and `an ordinary refusal is retried like any other drop`
/// bracket the new `if`: deleting it must fail the credential cases and leave
/// both of those green, or the arm was a redirection of the version arm rather
/// than an addition beside it.
///
/// **The half this file does not own.** The credential-disclosure case pins the
/// *client's* half: the panel holds the token in `config.token` and must not
/// splice it into the string an operator reads. The gateway's half — that
/// `TokenRejected.reason` and `StatusParams.error` never echo the credential
/// back — is a server-side rule, tested server-side in 06-06. A case here that
/// scripted a gateway into echoing the token would be asserting the server's
/// rule from the one side that cannot enforce it.
