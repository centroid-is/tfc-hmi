/// `RemoteStateMan`: the `StateManApi` a panel actually holds.
///
/// The class is structurally `ChannelStateMan` — same store, same
/// synchronous-answers-from-cache shape, same `subscribe` adapter — and the
/// value of this file is entirely in the four differences a socket forces,
/// which `channel_state_man.dart:60-65` lists as deliberately absent there:
/// there is no connection at construction, every async method waits on a
/// readiness barrier, every request carries a deadline, and a write that dies
/// in flight resolves *unknown* rather than throwing.
///
/// **Why "constructs with nothing listening" is the first case.** The shared
/// contract suite calls `StateManApi Function() make` synchronously
/// (04-RESEARCH Finding 6), so a client that connected in its constructor could
/// not be handed to it at all. That constraint is also the right production
/// shape: a panel in the packing hall boots with the rest of the line, on a
/// switch still learning MAC addresses, and a client that threw at construction
/// would put the plant's start-up order in the operator's hands.
///
/// **The bite for CLI-06** is `an unchanged value notifies nobody`. A store
/// wired to notify unconditionally passes every other value case in this file —
/// the numbers are all correct, they just arrive too often — and fails that one.
/// It is asserted with an anti-vacuity arm in the same case: the counter must
/// move for the changed value that follows, or the zero is a measurement of
/// nothing.
///
/// **The bite for the write path** is `a reconnect re-queries status and never
/// re-actuates`. An implementation that re-sent the original `write` after a
/// reconnect passes "the write eventually resolves" and fails that one — and on
/// a plant, re-sending is a second stroke of a ram an operator commanded once.
