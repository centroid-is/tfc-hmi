/// SEC-02 from the panel's end: one pinned root, and everything else refused.
///
/// The gateway's half is `tfc_relay_server/test/tls_test.dart`. This file is
/// the same property seen from the machine on the plant floor — the one that
/// decides whether the thing answering is the gateway — driven through the
/// production dial rather than a hand-built socket, so what is proven is the
/// panel's own wiring: `ClientConfig.tls` → one
/// `SecurityContext(withTrustedRoots: false)` → one `HttpClient` →
/// `IOWebSocketChannel.connect(customClient:)`.
///
/// **Every rejection arm varies exactly one thing, and none of them assert
/// why.** 06-RESEARCH §A.3 measured the wrong CA, the expired leaf and the
/// system trust store producing byte-identical text
/// (`CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED: application verification failure`) with a null
/// close code (trap 16). A case that matched the message and claimed "expired"
/// would pass just as happily when the CA was wrong, so what names the cause
/// here is how the arm is *built*: the same fixture, one input changed, said
/// in the case name.
///
/// **A refusal is not evidence unless the listener speaks TLS.** Dialling
/// `wss://` at a *plaintext* listener also raises a `HandshakeException`, so
/// an arm whose server never bound wss would pass for the wrong reason.
/// [_assertServesTls] is the control the server package's `tls_test.dart`
/// established (06-03, "measured facts" §4) and it is copied here with its
/// argument: a `ws://` dial that comes back `HttpException` proves the
/// listener is TLS. The system-roots arm needs none — it shares its `setUp`
/// server with the hostname arm, which completes a pinned handshake against
/// it.
///
/// **Every dial carries a bound.** An unreachable address takes 75 s to fail
/// on macOS (06-RESEARCH §C.4, trap 17). Direct dials pass `connectTimeout:`
/// and every panel here is built on a `ClientConfig` whose `connectTimeout` is
/// set, which is what bounds the dials the supervisor makes for itself.
///
/// **Certificates are minted at test time, never committed.** The client
/// package cannot import another package's `test/` directory, so the wiring of
/// `tfc_relay_server/test/support/certs.dart` is reproduced here over the
/// barrel-exported `mintCertificate` — the same minter the CLI uses, so these
/// fixtures prove the tool rather than resembling it. One RSA keypair costs
/// ~364 ms and every certificate signed from it costs 3–18 ms (06-01), so the
/// pairs are cached for the isolate and the certificates are free.
///
/// Without this file the panel can ship dialling `wss://` on the machine's own
/// trust store — connecting to nothing at all in the plant, or worse, to
/// whatever a rogue root installed on that station is willing to vouch for.
