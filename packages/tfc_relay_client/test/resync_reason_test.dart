/// Source: 09-07 (RES-02 row F22, clause 2), Ruling 5a. Until this landed,
/// `connection_supervisor.dart`'s `_resynced` decoded `ResyncParams`, used only
/// `asked.sub`, and threw `asked.reason` and `asked.stalledMs` on the floor —
/// so `RemoteStateMan` had `lastDownReason` (the socket dropped), `stopReason`
/// (the gateway refused this build) and `complaints` (the diagnostic list), and
/// **no way to say "the gateway stalled"**, though the gateway put exactly that
/// on the wire. That is structurally the pub/sub survey's finding for the tick
/// sequence, in a third place: the wire carries the fact, the client decodes it
/// and discards it (07-07's G1 precedent, made explicit for this row).
///
/// **These arms use a real socket** because the thing under test is a
/// notification handler, and a notification handler needs a `Peer`, which needs
/// a channel. The scripted gateway below is `resync_test.dart`'s
/// `_SequencedGateway` aimed at a different property: that one scripts sequences
/// to drive recovery, this one scripts `resync` notifications to drive the
/// stall surface.
