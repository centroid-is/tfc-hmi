/// Decoding a `subscribe` result — against wire text, because every trap here

///
/// Source: 04-RESEARCH Finding 7, recorded from a live subscribe against
/// `relayFixture()`. The result carries `[sub, epoch, seq, handles, meta,
/// snapshot]`; `handles` is `{PIPE.connected: 1, …}`; `snapshot` and `meta`
/// are keyed by **handle as a JSON string**; and `rejected` comes back
/// **absent**, not `{}`.
///
/// Every fixture below is a JSON *string* run through `jsonDecode`, never a
/// hand-built Dart map. That is the whole point: a hand-built
/// `{1: {'v': true}}` has int keys and a hand-built `double.infinity` is
/// visibly infinite, so a decoder written against Dart literals passes a suite
/// that never contains the two things that actually arrive — string keys and
/// `1e999`, which `jsonDecode` turns into `Infinity` in silence.
///
/// What breaks in the plant without this: STATE.md records that Phase 1's
/// defect cluster was the decode boundary — 5 of 5 Criticals. None of these
/// failures crash. A snapshot filed under the string `"1"` leaves every tag on
/// the page reading "not yet known" forever while the socket looks healthy; an
/// absent `rejected` map taken as a `Map` blanks a page over one hand-typed
/// key; and an `Infinity` that reaches the cache renders as a plausible
/// number under good quality and detonates on the next encode.
