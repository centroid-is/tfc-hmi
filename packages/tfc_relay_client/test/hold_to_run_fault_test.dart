/// The third release path: the link dies under a live hold.
///
/// Source: 05-CONTEXT decision 2 — each of the three release paths gets its
/// own test, and this one is the path the other two cannot reach. The
/// in-memory harness has no link to lose, and the channel pair forwards
/// client-to-server verbatim by design with `sever()` dropping only
/// server-to-client (05-RESEARCH trap 8), so the fault this case exists for is
/// not one that harness can produce. It runs against a real gateway over a
/// real socket with the real `FaultProxy` in front of it (D-P5-M).
///
/// Source: 05-RESEARCH §G.3 — the release is immediate on leaving `ready`,
/// never bounded by a write deadline, because the counter has already stopped
/// reaching the plant and waiting would leave the panel showing a live hold
/// for up to two budgets. The release write is still attempted; it resolves
/// `WriteUnknown(link_down)`, which is the honest answer and costs nothing.
///
/// **Its own file, not `fault_contract_test.dart`.** That file carries the
/// suite-through-the-proxy accounting and 05-06's leg constants, and this
/// plan's work lands in the same wave as edits to those. Two plans editing one
/// file across two waves is a merge conflict wearing a test's clothes; the
/// duplication that costs — the fixture wiring below — is one call to a shared
/// `support/` helper.
///
/// **Every timing assertion is a window.** The bands are the package's, Linux
/// 20/100 and 75/150 elsewhere, and nothing here reads a proxy state at an
/// instant: a connect attempt has been measured completing on the far side of
/// a proxy state transition.
