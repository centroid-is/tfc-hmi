/// WRT-03: no code path in this system re-sends a write on its own.
///
/// **What the requirement claims.** A re-send is always an operator decision.
/// Not on a timeout, not on a reconnect, not on the one verdict that is
/// re-send-safe (`not_received`) — the machine never decides to actuate a
/// second time because the first answer was slow or absent. CLAUDE.md states
/// it as "never auto-retried", and it is the sentence the whole three-state
/// `WriteResult` exists to keep enforceable: "unknown" is only honest if
/// nothing downstream quietly turns it into "try again".
///
/// **The behavioural half already exists, in three places.** They are named
/// here rather than restated, because a fourth copy of an existing assertion is
/// a maintenance cost that buys nothing:
///
///  * `tfc_stateman_contract/lib/src/write_contract.dart:341-365` —
///    `checkExactlyOneUpstreamAttemptPerCmd`, which runs against every
///    implementation on every leg and asserts the plant's own attempt counter
///    is 1 for both an ordinary write and one whose outcome nobody knows.
///  * `test/gate/half_open_gate_test.dart:148` — F5a, a write across a
///    total blackhole: `debugWritesSent == 1`.
///  * `test/gate/write_in_flight_gate_test.dart:91-104` — F7a, the link killed
///    with a write on the wire: `debugWritesSent == 1` before the reconnect and
///    again after the `writeStatus` re-query, because the recovery asks about
///    the command rather than repeating it.
///
/// **What this file adds is the structural half.** Every one of those cases
/// judges a retry that exists. None of them says anything about a retry that
/// does not exist *yet* — and the way this property dies is not a broken test,
/// it is somebody wrapping a send in a `for` loop or a `.retry()` extension in
/// a refactor that looks like plumbing. So the four seams through which a write
/// can reach the plant are pinned at exactly one call site each, measured in
/// this tree, with the failure message naming the file and line of every
/// occurrence found — so a second call site reads as "here is the second
/// actuation" and not as "expected 1, got 2".
///
/// **What the structural arm does not prove** (05-RESEARCH §D.2). It pins
/// *call sites* and one scheduling primitive. It does not pin control flow: a
/// `for (var i = 0; i < 2; i++)` wrapped around the one existing
/// `sendRequest` passes every case in groups 1 and 2, because there is still
/// exactly one call site. That gap is what group 3 is for — it watches the
/// plant's own counter across a link flap, where a loop shows up as a second
/// attempt no matter how it was spelled. Neither group is sufficient alone;
/// the pair is.
///
/// An analyzer plugin would close the gap properly and was rejected for a
/// stated reason (05-RESEARCH §D.2 arm 3): it needs `analyzer` as a dependency,
/// which is the version-solve blocker three pubspecs in this workspace name
/// explicitly. A grep pin plus a behavioural arm is the cheapest honest
/// mechanism, and "honest" is doing work in that sentence — see the paragraph
/// above.
///
/// **Why there is no `retry` substring sweep.** It was measured and it is not
/// pinnable: `retry` appears 3 times in `lib/src/client_config.dart` and 10
/// times in `lib/src/connection_supervisor.dart` in non-comment text, and all
/// thirteen are *reconnect* vocabulary — `_retry` the backoff timer, "the very
/// first retry would already…" in a config refusal. Retrying a dial is
/// legitimate and necessary; retrying a write is the thing this file exists to
/// forbid. A sweep that could not tell them apart would be switched off within
/// a month. Do not add one.
///
/// **Precedent.** The sweep helpers are `tfc_relay_server`'s
/// `test/handler_table_test.dart:110-158` (`_testFiles` / `_mentions`) and both
/// of its anti-vacuity arms at `:192-214`; the read-the-source-as-text shape
/// with an `existsSync` guard is `test/client_config_test.dart:202-222`.
