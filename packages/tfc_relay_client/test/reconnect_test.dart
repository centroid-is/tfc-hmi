/// The connection supervisor: four states, a fresh peer per socket, and a
/// backoff that only forgives a link which actually delivered a snapshot.
///
/// Source: 04-RESEARCH Finding 2, whose state table is the spec, and whose one
/// load-bearing line is CLI-02's testable property — **backoff resets on entry
/// to `ready`, not on entry to `resyncing`**. Finding 2 also carries the
/// measured caveat this file refuses to let the implementation forget: a
/// `killOnce` through the fault proxy reported `closeCode = 1002` with an empty
/// reason, so a yanked cable is indistinguishable-by-code from a protocol
/// error, and reconnect policy may not be read off the number.
///
/// What breaks in the plant without this file: the gateway is a single process
/// and every panel in the factory loses its socket in the same second when it
/// restarts. A supervisor that reset its backoff the moment a socket came up —
/// before any snapshot landed — would bring the whole factory back at the
/// attempt-0 window over and over against a gateway still replaying snapshots
/// for the previous wave. That is the thundering herd, and it is
/// self-sustaining: the synchronised retry is what keeps the gateway too busy
/// to finish, which is what keeps the retries synchronised.
///
/// **The bite.** `a server that closes before the snapshot does not earn a
/// reset` is the arm that fails an implementation which calls
/// `backoff.reset()` on entry to `resyncing`. Every happy-path reconnect case
/// in this file passes under that wrong implementation, which is exactly why
/// the flap arm exists and why it asserts a *band* rather than an instant: the
/// schedule is jittered, so the only honest claim is about the window a draw
/// came from, and a seeded `Random` is what makes that claim deterministic.
