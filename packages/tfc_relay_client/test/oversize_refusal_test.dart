/// A query too large to answer is a sentence, not a disconnect — over a real
/// socket, and through the fault proxy.
///
/// ## What this file is for
///
/// Every ceiling in this gateway before 10-10 was on ingress or on accumulated
/// bytes. A *response* goes into the session's priority lane, un-conflated,
/// drained only by the tick, and nothing bounded what one answer could be. An
/// undownsampled month-long window is about 21 MiB against a lane of 8, so the
/// verdict is `BufferDisconnect` → `close(4004)` and the operator is told they
/// disconnected. They did not; they asked for too much. 10-CONTEXT amendment 3
/// is that the gateway **refuses**, and that the refusal must never surface as
/// a disconnect.
///
/// The database-side boundary is 10-10 task 2's, in `tfc_relay_local`'s db
/// lane. This file is about what the **wire and the session** do with the
/// refusal once it is raised, and those are separable: the source here is a
/// `FakeTimeseries` that raises `ResultTooLarge` on demand, so these cases run
/// in this package's ordinary lane in a second rather than behind Docker.
///
/// ## Why it is not a contract check
///
/// `allContractChecks` is **51** and both leg constants are 51 with empty gap
/// lists — 50 until the 10-REVIEW fix cycle added the eighth data-services
/// check (CR-02, `preferences.clear`). This is a case *beside* them: the
/// contract is about properties every
/// `StateManApi` implementation must have, and "the gateway refuses an
/// over-large result rather than evicting you" is a property of this gateway's
/// wire, which `RemoteStateMan` has no way to satisfy on its own. Registering
/// it would move a number that three other files cross-check by text.
///
/// ## Reading the close assertions
///
/// `closeCode` on the client's own socket is null after a self-initiated close
/// on every platform (dart-lang/http#1698), so "the socket looks open" proves
/// nothing. What is asserted is the **gateway's own tracked code**:
/// `RelaySession.sentCloseCode`, and `RelayServer.closeLedger`, which is what
/// an operator's "did it leave, or did we evict it?" question is answered from.
