/// The app heartbeat: the one periodic frame this client owes the gateway.
///
/// **What is being asserted, and why it needed a plan of its own.** The gateway
/// reaps any session that has gone a `heartbeatDeadline` without an inbound
/// application frame. A panel that only watches a page sends nothing after its
/// handshake, so before `heartbeat_pump.dart` existed every healthy panel in
/// the plant was closed with `4003`, redialled and resynced its whole page once
/// every six seconds — measured, three reaps in twenty-one idle seconds, in
/// 07-08-SUMMARY deviation 3. `test/gate/herd_gate_test.dart`'s idle-liveness
/// case is that measurement inverted and is the end-to-end proof; this file is
/// the mechanism, case by case.
///
/// **Why the cases below are mostly unit cases over a scripted peer.** Every
/// property this pump has is a property about *what it does not do* — does not
/// beat while the link is down, does not buffer a beat it could not send, does
/// not send anything but a ping, does not hold a timer it is not using. Each of
/// those is a negative over a window, and a negative over a window costs
/// wall-clock seconds. Driven against a real gateway at a real cadence the set
/// would be a minute of lane time; driven over `StreamChannelController` with a
/// 40 ms floor it is under two seconds and the assertions are stronger, because
/// the frames are read off the wire rather than inferred from a counter. The
/// two arms that genuinely need a socket — the wiring to `LinkState` and the
/// pre-handshake silence — are at the bottom and use the real fixture.
///
/// The scripted-peer shape is `deadline_test.dart:55-111`'s, including the
/// reason its controller is not `sync: true`.
