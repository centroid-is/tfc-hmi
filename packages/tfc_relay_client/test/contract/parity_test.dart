/// One registry, two legs, and a difference that must be exactly the named gap.
///
/// `ws_contract_test.dart` proves the gateway leg is green. Green is not the
/// claim this file makes. A leg can be green while judging a *different set of
/// properties* than the reference does — a case dropped by a capability flag,
/// a case rebound to a weaker lever, a case that only ever ran in memory — and
/// every one of those leaves both drivers green and this file red.
///
/// **Why a count would not do.** The obvious version of this test compares two
/// numbers: the reference passes 44, the gateway passes 31, 44 − 31 = 13, done.
/// That arithmetic holds just as well if the gateway silently failed
/// `a rejected write carries a greppable reason` and silently passed one of the
/// browse checks against a handler that answers something plausible and wrong.
/// Two legs agreeing on a number while judging different checks is the whole
/// failure this file exists to catch, so what is compared here is **set
/// membership**: `channel.passes − ws.passes` must equal
/// [unreachableChecks] element for element, and `ws.passes − channel.passes`
/// must be empty. There is no `.length` anywhere in the parity assertion or in
/// the two arms either side of it. The five in the file are all elsewhere and
/// all accounted for: two in the coverage case (`swept` against the registry),
/// two in the budget case's printed line, and one in `_Sweep.agree`, which is
/// the anti-vacuity guard — the one place a count is the right question,
/// because "fewer than two legs" is exactly what makes a comparison vacuous.
///
/// **The legs are rebound, never reduced.** Both legs run the whole registry
/// with no capability flag anywhere — strictly stronger than
/// `ws_contract_test.dart`'s all-true flags, because there is no flag here to
/// switch off. Two cases take a lever per leg, exactly as `runWriteContract`
/// rebinds them: the read-only case needs a declared key on *both* legs or it
/// would judge different things on each, and the lost-link case needs the
/// gateway leg's deferred cut (`dropUpstreamUnderAWriteInFlight`) because over
/// a socket the default lever fires before the write has left. A rebinding
/// changes *how* a property is provoked on one transport; it never adds or
/// removes a case, which is the contract library's own doctrine
/// (`tfc_stateman_contract.dart:128-131`) and is what keeps the compared sets
/// the same size as the registry.
///
/// **This sweep is proven to bite**, three ways. A sweep with no legs and a
/// sweep with no checks each report zero outcomes rather than agreement — two
/// empty sets are equal, which is the greenest thing a comparison can say about
/// nothing. And a deliberately broken leg from the kit's own sabotage fakes is
/// reported as a difference *by property name*, so the mechanism is shown to
/// notice a leg that behaves differently rather than merely to run.
