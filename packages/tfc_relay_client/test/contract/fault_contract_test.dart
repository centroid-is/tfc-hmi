/// The contract suite with a fault proxy in the path.
///
/// **The named scenarios moved to `test/gate/` in Phase 7 (07-02).** F1/F8,
/// F4/F5, F7, F13 and F18 are now five files there, named by their catalogue
/// row so `test/gate/gate_manifest_test.dart` can count them against the
/// F1–F21 registry without anyone claiming a row by hand. Their bodies did not
/// change in the move.
///
/// What stayed is this file's other half, and the two answer different
/// questions. A scenario case asks whether one named fault behaves the way the
/// catalogue says it must — it injects, it waits, it judges one property. This
/// leg asks something the gate cannot: whether *the whole contract*, all 44
/// checks of it, still holds with two extra loopback hops and a lever in the
/// path. Its output is an accounting — `reachableThroughTheProxy`, the named
/// gap, and the cross-read against the WS leg — and that accounting is about
/// contract checks, not scenarios. Moving the scenarios out therefore changes
/// none of the numbers below; if it had, the move would have been the finding.
///
/// **The suite through the proxy** asks whether the properties survive two
/// extra loopback hops with a lever on them. The settings are benign — a few
/// milliseconds of latency and a rate no snapshot in this suite comes near —
/// because the claim is *the same 44 properties, judged the same way*, not
/// "the client copes with a bad link", which is the second half's job. The
/// counts are asserted exactly as the WS leg asserts them: a fault path that
/// quietly runs fewer checks is the same defect as a leg that lowered a
/// capability flag, and it is harder to spot because the report still says the
/// fault leg passed.
///
/// **Every timing assertion is a window.** STATE's Phase 2 handoff measured a
/// connect attempt completing on the far side of a proxy state transition —
/// `t=1204ms forwarding=false connect OK in 189ms` — so a flag read at
/// assertion time does not describe what the connection experienced. Nothing
/// here compares a duration for equality and nothing reads a proxy state at an
/// instant; the bands are the same ones the other two packages use, Linux
/// 20/100 and 75/150 elsewhere, because two packages that disagree about what
/// "on time" means would eventually disagree about whether the gateway is
/// healthy.
///
/// **Every case that depends on prior state carries an anti-vacuity arm.** A
/// fault case is the easiest kind of test to write vacuously: cut a link that
/// was never carrying anything and assert that nothing was lost.
///
/// **Every leg here is plaintext, and that is a decision rather than an
/// oversight.** `faultFixture` grew an opt-in TLS mode in 06-07 and nothing in
/// this file uses it, for two reasons that both cost something if a future
/// reader "upgrades" these legs to wss. First, a TLS fixture cannot install a
/// [FrameSeam]: the seam arrives through `dial:`, and a fixture that passes
/// `dial:` bypasses the panel's own pinned `HttpClient` — so `fixture.seam`
/// throws on a TLS leg, and the gate files' `inject` and `seam.dials` readings
/// would go with it. Second, and less visibly, byte-level truncation stops
/// meaning what it means here: `cutMidFrame(n)` counts wire bytes, so under TLS
/// the cut lands inside a TLS record, the record is discarded whole, and the
/// decoder receives *nothing* rather than a fragment (measured in
/// `tls_fault_test.dart`'s last group: 64 bytes across the wire, zero bytes to
/// the decoder). The frame-level truncations these legs and
/// `truncated_write_test.dart` depend on live one layer above the socket and
/// must stay there. The TLS failure paths have their own file; this one keeps
/// the decoder honest.
