/// These are **three separate numbers with three separate jobs**, and the one
/// change to resist here is collapsing them into a single "timeout". They
/// answer different questions and they fail differently when they are wrong:
///
/// - [slack] is measurement tolerance — how far either side of an expected
///   instant a real event may land before the reading is called wrong. It
///   widens a comparison; it never waits for anything.
/// - [recovery] is a liveness budget — how long "the panel came back" is
///   allowed to take. It bounds a wait; a case that used [slack] here would
///   report a healthy reconnect as a failure.
/// - [settle] is the opposite shape: it is spent on purpose, in the one case
///   family where the property is that *nothing* happened. A poll cannot
///   establish an absence, so this is a delay rather than a budget, and using
///   [recovery] here would make every such case five seconds long for no
///   additional evidence.
///
/// Collapse them and the gate keeps passing while it stops measuring: a
/// tolerance used as a budget is a case that waits 20 ms for a reconnect, and a
/// budget used as a tolerance is a case that accepts a five-second round trip
/// as on time.
///
/// **The slack pair is mirrored in `tfc_relay_server/test/support/bands.dart`
/// and must not diverge.** Two packages that disagree about what "on time"
/// means will eventually disagree about whether the gateway is healthy — one
/// side's green and the other side's red, over the same link, with no way to
/// tell which one is describing the plant. The expression below is
/// byte-identical to that file's `slack`; if one moves, the other moves in the
/// same commit and the reason is recorded in both.
///
/// **Why the non-Linux band is nearly four times wider.** The Linux leg is a
/// quiet dedicated runner and 20 ms is the resolution that would notice a
/// mechanism which had quietly stopped working. The hosted macOS and Windows
/// runners are neither quiet nor dedicated, and tens of milliseconds of
/// event-loop jitter there is ordinary. At 20 ms those legs go red about the
/// runner while naming the mode under test, which trains people to re-run CI
/// until it passes — and a real regression then gets re-run too.
///
/// Assert windows, not instants: `lessThan(ceiling)`, never an equality on a
/// duration.
