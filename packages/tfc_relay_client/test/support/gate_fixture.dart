/// N real panels on one gateway, a gateway that can be restarted underneath
/// them, and the counters that prove the numbers above are being measured
/// rather than assumed.
///
/// **Why this is a second fixture and not a parameter on the first.**
/// `fault_fixture.dart` builds exactly one client, and its teardown order is
/// load-bearing prose: plant, gateway, proxy and panel are released in an order
/// that is argued in that file's library doc and nowhere else. Adding an `n:`
/// to it would make that order an *inherited* property — a reader of a herd
/// case would have to open the other file to find out what is torn down when,
/// and a change to either lifetime would silently change the other's. The two
/// fixtures have genuinely different lifetimes (that one's gateway is built
/// once and never replaced; this one's is closed and rebound mid-case), so the
/// wiring is **copied with its reasons restated** rather than shared. That is
/// 07-RESEARCH trap 16's instruction, and the cost — two places that must not
/// drift — is the price of the order staying readable in one place.
///
/// **Teardown order, and why it is registered backwards.** `addTearDown` runs
/// last-registered-first, so the registrations below read backwards from the
/// order they execute in: plant, then proxies, then gateway, then every client
/// — executing as **all clients, then the gateway, then the proxies, then the
/// plant**. That is `ws_harness.dart:359-384`'s order, which
/// `client_harness.dart:330-340` restates: the client goes first because it
/// owns the socket and both its timers and because it is the only participant
/// that *reconnects* (a gateway closed under a live panel leaves that panel
/// dialling a dead port for the rest of the run, and the attempts land as
/// noise on whichever case is unlucky enough to be running then); the proxy
/// cannot go first because shutting it down destroys both halves of every pair
/// it carries; and the plant goes last because its freshness watchdog must
/// outlive anything still draining through it.
///
/// With N clients the rule is unchanged and the *whole* client group goes
/// first, which is why each client registers its own teardown in the loop that
/// builds it rather than one teardown closing the list — a single closure would
/// still be one registration, and one registration cannot be reordered against
/// the gateway's if a later reader adds something between them.
///
/// **The listen port is fixed from the first bind, not chosen by us.**
/// `FaultProxy.targetPort` is `final` (`fault_proxy.dart:149`), a Phase 2
/// artifact guarded by `proxy_core_test.dart` and `mode_integrity_test.dart`,
/// so a gateway that is restarted behind a proxy must come back on the port it
/// left. 07-RESEARCH §A.3 argues at length that making `targetPort` mutable is
/// the strictly worse route, and Phase 6 landed the field this needs:
/// `ServerConfig.port`, defaulting to `0`.
///
/// So the first gateway binds `port: 0` — the OS picks — and every replacement
/// binds `ServerConfig(port: <that number>)`. The port is fixed for the
/// fixture's whole life, which is all the proxy requires, and it is a port the
/// kernel has just confirmed is free rather than a number this file guessed
/// and another process might own. See [GateFixture.restartGateway] for the
/// rebind and its retry.
///
/// **TLS is opt-in, it reuses 06-07's support rather than a second one of its
/// own, and what it changes is the dial rather than the proxy.** Pass a
/// [FaultTls] — `fault_fixture.dart`'s own record type, imported, not
/// re-declared — and every gateway this fixture binds serves `wss` from the
/// mounted chain, every panel dials `wss://127.0.0.1:<proxy port>` pinning the
/// mounted root, and the proxy is untouched. It does not have to change:
/// `FaultProxy` is a loopback *byte* relay (`fault_proxy.dart:141-190`) that
/// forwards through a `DelayLine` and never inspects a frame, so it shapes
/// ciphertext without knowing that is what it is doing. The default is off, so
/// every existing herd and slow-link case is byte-identical.
///
/// **Why this parameter exists at all when `faultFixture` already had one.**
/// 06-07 built the wss leg on the *one-panel* fixture, and that is still where
/// every single-panel TLS case belongs — `tls_gate_test.dart`'s F15 arms use it
/// directly. What that shape does not extend to is N panels on one gateway and
/// a `serverConfig` builder, which is what a full-page smoke row over `wss` and
/// an auth-refusal contrast need. So the *mount type, the client config helper
/// and the pinning discipline are shared* and only the N-panel wiring is here.
/// Two ways to mint a certificate in one package would be how the next reader
/// picks the wrong one; two ways to stand up a herd would be worse.
///
/// **A TLS leg has no [FrameSeam], by construction** — the same rule
/// `fault_fixture.dart` states and for the same reason. The seam is installed by
/// passing `dial:` to `RemoteStateMan`, and a fixture that passes `dial:`
/// bypasses the panel's own pinned `HttpClient`, which is the thing a TLS leg
/// exists to exercise. So [GateClient.seam] throws on a TLS panel rather than
/// handing back a lens nobody installed, and [GateClient.observedClose] reports
/// nothing for the same reason: it is read off the attempt the `dial:` wrapper
/// kept. [GateClient.attempts] is unaffected — it counts `LinkState.connecting`
/// transitions off the panel's own stream — and it is the dial counter a TLS
/// case wants anyway (see its doc).
