/// One `RemoteStateMan`, one real `RelayServer`, one real WebSocket, and the
/// plant behind the server — built **synchronously**, which is the whole
/// difficulty.
///
/// This is `ws_harness.dart`'s `relayFixture` (server package,
/// `test/support/`) rebuilt in this package's test tree, for the reason 04-07
/// already hit and wrote down: another package's `test/` directory is not
/// addressable by any `package:` URI, so the wiring is copied rather than
/// imported. Where a decision was argued there it is re-argued here in one
/// line and the original is cited, because the argument is the value.
///
/// **Why a dial seam and not a port number.** The shared contract suite calls
/// `StateManApi Function() make` synchronously (04-RESEARCH Finding 6): there
/// is nothing to await between "the suite wants an implementation" and "the
/// suite starts driving it". A `RelayServer` binds port 0 on purpose
/// (`relay_server.dart:219-247`) so two servers can share a test process, so
/// its port exists only after an asynchronous bind. Those two facts cannot
/// both be satisfied by a URI known at construction. Rather than guess a port
/// — a guess that collides is a flaky suite blaming the client for the
/// operating system — the fixture hands `RemoteStateMan` a `dial` that waits
/// for the bind and then dials the real port. Everything downstream of the
/// dial is unchanged: one attempt, one `ConnectAttempt`, the supervisor's own
/// backoff, the client's own readiness barrier. A call issued before the
/// server is up waits on the barrier exactly as it does at plant power-on.
///
/// **Levers never touch the wire.** `rpc_names.dart` keeps `setValue`,
/// `failNextWrite`, `setQuality` and the rest off any method table a connected
/// client can reach — putting them on it would be an access-control change
/// wearing a testing convenience (T-04-30). So [RelayServedFake] forwards
/// every `StateManApi` call to the client, over the socket, and routes every
/// plant lever **directly** to the `FakeStateMan` the server sits on. Every
/// lever in this file is a `served.` call and there is no string form of one
/// anywhere.
///
/// **A missing observable throws; it never reads zero.** The rule and its
/// reasoning are `channel_state_man.dart:345-392`'s, and behind a gateway it
/// bites harder than it does over a channel: a `cmd` the plant has never heard
/// of returns an attempt count of 0, and 0 is precisely the answer the
/// no-auto-retry case is hunting for. Handing it over for free would make that
/// case pass on a client that re-sent every unanswered write. See
/// [RelayServedFake.upstreamWriteAttempts].
///
/// What breaks in the plant without this file: nothing directly — but nothing
/// judges `RemoteStateMan` against the same 44 properties `LocalStateMan` is
/// held to either, and CLI-01 is exactly that claim.
