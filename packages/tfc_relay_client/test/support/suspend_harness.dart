/// A real panel in a second isolate, pausable and resumable — F16's SIGSTOP,
/// spelled in a way that works on all three platforms.
///
/// **Why an isolate at all.** The catalogue's lever for F16 is `SIGSTOP` on the
/// client process. In-process that is impossible — a stopped process cannot run
/// the code that would assert anything about itself — and `Process.killPid` with
/// `ProcessSignal.sigstop` needs a child process with its own entry point and
/// gives nothing at all on Windows. `Isolate.pause()` is the genuine analogue:
/// the paused isolate's event loop stops, so its socket is not read and bytes
/// pile up in the kernel exactly as they do under `SIGSTOP`, and it is a
/// VM-level API with no platform story. 07-RESEARCH §A.4 measured it — 15 ticks
/// in 300 ms, **0 ticks across 600 ms of pause**, then the ordinary rate again
/// — and `suspend_gate_test.dart` re-runs that measurement as its first case so
/// the number is this platform's rather than that probe's.
///
/// **This harness is F16-only and is deliberately not generalised.** It exists
/// because a test cannot call a method on a client that lives in another
/// isolate; a "run any client remotely" helper would be a second fixture with
/// its own lifetime rules, and the next reader would have to learn it before
/// reading one row. 07-RESEARCH §A.4's instruction, followed.
///
/// **The plant, the gateway and any proxy stay in the test isolate.** Only the
/// panel moves. Everything a case injects, samples or asserts about the
/// *gateway* is therefore an ordinary in-process read; the only thing that
/// crosses the isolate boundary is what the panel itself can see, and it
/// crosses as plain maps. Nothing is shared, because a shared object would have
/// to survive being paused.
///
/// **Two channels, and the second one is the instrument.**
///
///  * [SuspendedPanel.ask] is a bounded request/reply — the command protocol.
///    It fails naming the command rather than hanging, which is what makes "the
///    isolate is not answering" an assertion instead of a timeout on the case.
///  * The panel also *pushes* a [PanelReport] on every one of its own periodic
///    ticks, and the tick counter in that report is the whole of F16's
///    no-burst clause. A pushed report is what lets a case say "zero of these
///    arrived across the pause": a paused isolate sends nothing, so the absence
///    is observed rather than inferred, and there is no poll racing the pause.
///
/// **Subscription happens at construction, so there is no `subscribe`
/// command.** `RemoteStateMan` takes its page as a constructor argument and
/// dials from its own constructor, so the keys handed to [SuspendedPanel.spawn]
/// are the panel's page from the first frame. A `subscribe` command would be a
/// second way to build the same state, live only in this file, and F16 has no
/// clause that needs one.
