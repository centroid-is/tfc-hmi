/// A real gateway, a real socket, optionally a fault proxy and optionally a
/// lens on the frames — one call, torn down in the right order.
///
/// The wiring is `remote_state_man_test.dart:85-128`'s, lifted into `support/`
/// because three fault legs now need it and a fourth copy of it would be a
/// fourth place for the teardown order to be got wrong. Its argument is
/// unchanged and worth repeating: the server package's own `relayFixture` is
/// not reachable from here, because another package's `test/` directory is not
/// addressable by any `package:` URI, so the wiring is copied rather than
/// imported.
///
/// **What this is not.** `client_harness.dart`'s `relayFixture` is the
/// *contract-leg* fixture: it builds the whole 314-key page, wears the
/// contract's control surfaces, and is handed to `runStateManContract`. This
/// one is for a case that drives the client by hand — it takes the keys the
/// case names, hands back the plant and the proxy directly, and adds the one
/// thing the contract fixture has no business owning: a [FrameSeam] on the
/// dial.
///
/// **Teardown order, and why it is not `addTearDown` in declaration order.**
/// `addTearDown` runs last-registered-first, so the registrations below read
/// backwards from the order they execute in: plant, then proxy, then server,
/// then client — executing as client, server, proxy, plant. That is
/// `ws_harness.dart:359-384`'s order read from the inside out. The client goes
/// first because it owns the socket and both its timers and because it is the
/// only participant that *reconnects*: a server closed under a live client
/// leaves the client dialling a dead port for the rest of the run, and the
/// reconnect attempts land as noise on whichever case is unlucky enough to be
/// running then.
///
/// **TLS is opt-in, and what it changes is the dial rather than the proxy.**
/// Pass [FaultTls] to [faultFixture] and the gateway binds `wss` from the
/// mounted chain, the panel dials `wss://127.0.0.1:<proxy port>` pinning the
/// mounted root, and the proxy is left exactly as it was. It does not have to
/// change: `FaultProxy` is a loopback *byte* relay (`fault_proxy.dart:141-190`)
/// that forwards through a `DelayLine` and never inspects a frame, so it shapes
/// ciphertext with no idea that is what it is doing. The default is off, so
/// every existing fault case is byte-identical — the rule amendment 6 imposed
/// on the server's fixtures, kept here.
///
/// **Which modes still mean what they meant, stated as a property rather than
/// as a list to maintain.** The proxy moves bytes, so anything that *shapes* or
/// *withholds* bytes — `latency`, `throttle`, `flap`, `blackhole`, `killOnce`,
/// `reject`, `bufferServerToClient` — is unchanged under TLS: the peer's
/// observable is the same because the bytes it is waiting for are late,
/// missing, or gone either way. Anything that counts bytes and means them as
/// *application* bytes is not. There is exactly one of those: `cutMidFrame(n)`
/// counts wire bytes (`delay_line.dart:297,476,554`), and under TLS a cut after
/// n bytes lands inside a TLS record, so the record is discarded whole and the
/// WebSocket layer never sees half an application frame. `cutMidFrame`'s intent
/// — deliver half a JSON frame to the decoder — is **unreachable through a TLS
/// proxy**, and `tls_fault_test.dart`'s last group measures that rather than
/// pretending otherwise. Do not "fix" it, and do not grow this proxy a
/// byte-corruption lever to compensate: `ws_fault_test.dart:32-34` says why not.
/// The instrument that still reaches the decoder is [FrameSeam], one layer up.
///
/// **A TLS leg has no [FrameSeam], and that is the price of testing the real
/// dial.** The seam is installed by passing `dial:` to `RemoteStateMan`, and a
/// fixture that passes `dial:` bypasses the panel's own pinned `HttpClient`
/// (06-05) — which is the thing a TLS leg exists to exercise. So the TLS mode
/// omits `dial:`, [seam] throws rather than handing back a lens that is not in
/// the path, and `corrupt:` is refused at construction rather than ignored.
