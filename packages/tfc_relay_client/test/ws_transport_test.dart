/// The transport adapter, against two real ports: one listening, one closed.
///
/// Source: 04-RESEARCH Finding 2, executed. `WebSocketChannel.connect` to a
/// dead port surfaces as `WebSocketChannelException: SocketException:
/// Connection refused (errno 61)` from **both** `ws.ready` and the stream, and
/// `closeCode` is `null` — there never was a connection to close. So the
/// adapter awaits `ready` inside a try and reports an attempt failure, and the
/// duplicate copy of the same error must not be left to land on the isolate's
/// ambient handler.
///
/// What breaks in the plant without this file. Two things, both of which the
/// panel meets on its first bad morning:
///
/// * A gateway that is not up yet is the *normal* state of a panel at
///   power-on — the switch, the server and the screen all come up in whatever
///   order the electrician wired the contactors. If a refused connect escapes
///   as an unhandled async error instead of a value the supervisor can branch
///   on, the reconnect loop dies at the first attempt and the panel stays grey
///   until someone drives to the factory.
/// * The `.cast()` trap (`ws_channel.dart:4-20`, 03-RESEARCH Finding 1) binds
///   the socket's own sink with `addStream` and keeps it bound for the whole
///   life of the connection, so the next writer to reach past the channel gets
///   `Bad state: Cannot add event while adding stream` — measured again here,
///   on this side, in exactly that form. On the gateway the later writer is the
///   fan-out tick; on the panel it is the app-level heartbeat, which STACK
///   makes mandatory because Flutter web cannot send ping frames, and anything
///   else the supervisor has to say around the `Peer` that owns the channel.
///   Nothing warns at compile time: the panel connects, shows values, and the
///   first frame the supervisor sends on its own throws. The case named
///   `a second write on a live connection still lands` is the one that bites
///   it.
