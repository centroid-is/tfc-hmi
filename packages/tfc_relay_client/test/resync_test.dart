/// The resync discipline: epoch global, sequence local, snapshot only.
///
/// Source: 04-RESEARCH Finding 3, which is flagged **designed, not fully
/// executed** — the primitives were verified live (Finding 7) but no multi-sub
/// flap run happened, and RESEARCH's assumption log carries it as A1 with
/// "a two-sub flap test in Wave 0 settles it". This file is that test.
///
/// The arm that settles it is `a gap on one page does not blank the other`.
/// The server makes the same argument from its own side —
/// `subscription_registry.dart:101-102`: a sequence counter shared between two
/// subscriptions "would make each one resync every time the other moved".
///
/// What breaks in the plant without it: a control room runs several panels off
/// one gateway. If a dropped frame on the packing-hall page blanked the
/// freezer page too, one lost UDP-sized hiccup would take every screen in the
/// factory to "not yet known" at once, and the resulting resubscribe storm is
/// self-sustaining. And an engine that resynced everything on any gap passes
/// every single-subscription case in this file — which is why the two-sub arm
/// carries an anti-vacuity check that the other page held values at all.
///
/// **The last two groups do use a socket, and they have to** (07-07). What
/// triggers a recovery is not only a verdict the engine reaches on its own:
/// since 07-07 a *tick* whose advertised sequence is ahead of the client's
/// starts one, and an update naming a handle nobody announced starts one too.
/// Both decisions live in `ConnectionSupervisor`'s notification handlers, and a
/// notification handler needs a `Peer`, which needs a channel. So those arms
/// script a gateway on loopback and count the subscribes it is asked for — the
/// same instrument `reconnect_test.dart`'s `_FakeGateway` is, aimed at a
/// different property: that one scripts *closes and refusals* to drive the
/// backoff, this one scripts *sequences* to drive the recovery.
