///
/// **F15 — TLS handshake failure.** Injection: proxy to a plain-TCP port /
/// wrong cert. Expect: clear terminal error, no reconnect-forever at full speed
/// against a misconfigured endpoint.
///
/// **The row's operational teeth are F15d, and they are not about TLS at all.**
/// Four of the six arms below assert that a handshake fails and that the panel
/// says so, which Phase 6 already pinned directly. What no file in this
/// repository stated before this one is the clause an operator actually feels:
/// a panel pointed at a gateway whose certificate is wrong must **back off**,
/// not spin. That is a property of `connection_supervisor.dart`'s schedule, and
/// F15d measures it against a bound computed from the backoff schedule.
///
/// **Assert the union, never the discrimination.** 06-RESEARCH §A.3 measured
/// that a foreign CA, an expired leaf, a SAN that does not cover the address
/// and a private leaf against the system roots all produce a byte-identical
/// `WebSocketChannelException` wrapping `HandshakeException` with
/// `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED: application verification failure`, `closeCode`
/// null, in one to twenty-two milliseconds. A case asserting three different
/// messages would be asserting a fiction. One expected shape, three bindings —
/// and that *is* the finding, printed by the arms below rather than only
/// claimed here.
///
/// **06-07 measured a fifth shape that collapses into the first, and this file
/// inherits it.** `dart:io` raises `HandshakeException` for a link that dies
/// *inside* a handshake as well as for a leaf it refuses to verify, and
/// `_refusalReason` (`connection_supervisor.dart:384-406`) branches on the
/// class alone — so a cut cable and an impostor read identically on the health
/// line. The discriminator is in the text (`Connection terminated during
/// handshake` versus `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED`) and nothing here asserts on
/// it: narrowing that branch changes a sentence an operator acts on, which is a
/// decision and not a typo. F15e therefore asserts the **union** of
/// `HandshakeException` and `SocketException`, and the gap is in the deviations
/// registry against F15's `clear terminal error`.
///
/// **What Phase 6 already asserts, cited rather than repeated.** The gate's job
/// is the pipe, not the handshake:
///
///  - `test/tls_client_test.dart` — the pinned dial, the system-roots refusal,
///    and the `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` text itself.
///  - `test/tls_fault_test.dart` — the same four shapes through the fault
///    proxy, each with a recovery driven by a value the plant changed during
///    the outage, plus the `cutMidFrame`-under-TLS boundary.
///  - `tfc_relay_server/test/tls_test.dart` — the `wss` bind and the
///    `assertServesTls` anti-vacuity pattern.
///
/// This file asserts only the half those cannot: what the *panel* does over
/// time when the handshake keeps failing.
///
/// **No arm asserts a `FailureKind.tlsRejected`, and none may be added.**
/// 06-PLAN-INDEX records the constant as deliberately not built:
/// `classifyFailure` sorts *call* failures and never sees a `ConnectAttempt`,
/// so the member would have no producer, and `grep -c tlsRejected` returning 0
/// is one of 06-05's own acceptance criteria. What Phase 6 shipped instead is
/// the link-state reason string, and that is what the arms below read.
///
/// **One `wss` smoke row, not a second lane.** 06-RESEARCH §C.4 measured
/// `latency`, `throttle`, `flap`, `blackhole`, `killOnce` and `reject` as
/// unchanged under TLS — the proxy is a byte relay and shapes ciphertext
/// without knowing it — so running all twenty-seven rows over `wss` would
/// double an eight-minute lane to re-prove a property already measured.
/// 07-CONTEXT orchestrator ruling 3 settles it: one smoke row proving the
/// fixture carries a full subscribe and resync, plus this family. The decision
/// to leave the other rows plaintext is in the deviations registry with that
/// measurement as its reason, because a scope decision nobody wrote down is
/// indistinguishable from an oversight.
///
/// **Two cases here are deliberately not F-rows**, and both are declared in
/// `gate_manifest_test.dart`'s supporting-case exemption with a written reason.
/// The smoke row proves the fixture; naming it `F1c` would claim a second F1
/// and break the 1:1 row mapping the whole manifest exists to hold. The auth
/// contrast is ROADMAP criterion 4's second clause and the *other side* of the
/// supervisor branch F15d sits on — it belongs beside F15 and belongs to no row.
///
/// Without this file the phase ships a gate that has never seen a TLS
/// handshake, and the plant-side property nobody measured is the one that
