/// The herd family: the rows that need more than one panel on one gateway.
///
/// **F10 — Server process restart.** The catalogue's expectation is that the
/// client treats it as F1; server rebuilds subscription state from client's
/// re-subscribe (server holds no obligation to remember clients). F10 is F11
/// with N=1 and it ships beside it because it is F11's debugging step: a herd
/// that fails for a reason one panel would have shown is a bad afternoon.
///
/// **What the restart in this file is, said plainly.** It is an **in-process
/// `RelayServer.close()` followed by a rebind on the same port**, not a process
/// boundary. What that proves is the whole operational content of the row: the
/// epoch changes, the gateway's subscription registry starts empty, and the
/// page that comes back was rebuilt purely from the panel's own re-subscribe.
/// What it does **not** prove is anything about process startup, port reuse
/// across a `SIGKILL`, or a listener socket surviving into a child. Those need
/// a real process boundary, which needs a docker-compose tier this project does
/// not have, and they belong to the Phase 11 chaos soak. The deviations
/// registry carries the entry (`f_row_registry.dart`, row F10) and it points
/// here.
///
/// **F11 — Thundering herd.** all resubscribe; server tick cost stays bounded;
/// no client starves (fairness across resync bursts). Two halves of this row
/// already existed and neither is the row. `fanout_test.dart:80-120` runs fifty
/// clients through the gateway's encode-once path and proves the **server-cost**
/// half — one encode serves every session watching the same key — but those
/// clients are in-memory `Plant` sessions with no sockets, so they cannot
/// resubscribe, cannot starve and cannot be evicted. That half is cited here
/// and deliberately **not** re-run over sockets: it is measured where it is
/// cheap and it is measured correctly. What this file adds is the other half,
/// which is only expressible over real sockets: twenty real panels, a real
/// gateway restart, and the three things a herd can do wrong.
///
/// **F12 — Slow client / backpressure.** server buffer for that client stays
/// bounded via conflation (§7.6); other clients unaffected. The second clause
/// is this file's; the first is asserted from the gateway's side in
/// `backpressure_test.dart:327-393`, and asserted here as the panel-visible
/// consequence — the throttled panel keeps arriving at the *latest* value and
/// is never thrown off.
///
/// **G2 — Late joiner under sustained loss.** A client subscribing while the
/// link is throttled to 100 kbit and flapping must still reach a fresh,
/// complete view — the snapshot must not be starved by telemetry. Assert the
/// `subscribe` response (priority lane) beats the `u` backlog.
///
/// **Why the descriptor clause is not inside F11.** `openSocketCount` cannot
/// answer on Windows — there is no `/proc/self/fd` and no `lsof`
/// (`fd_count.dart:40-55`) — so an arm that measures descriptors has to skip
/// there. Putting that skip on F11 itself would make the row green-by-skip on
/// one column of the matrix, which is precisely the "capability switched off"
/// failure the manifest's own no-silent-skip sweep exists to catch one level
/// up. So F11 runs everywhere and judges everything a panel can observe, and
/// the descriptor measurement lives in the supporting control arm below, whose
/// per-test skip carries `openSocketCountSkipReason` verbatim.
