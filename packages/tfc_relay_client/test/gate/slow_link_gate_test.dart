///
/// F19 is the control arm of the slow-link family, and it has to exist before
/// F20 means anything. F20's claim is that a page which *cannot* fit is
/// conflated rather than queued; that claim is only interesting if the same
/// page on a link it *can* fit arrives whole and on time. Without this row,
/// "the client kept up" and "the client fell behind" are two measurements with
/// no shared baseline, and a client that had quietly halved its cadence
/// everywhere would satisfy both.
///
/// **G5 — Conflation is not eviction** (the NATS/Redis two-tier boundary).
/// Paired assertions: held above the ceiling every tick ⇒ evicted with the peak
/// verdict; held just under it for 40 ticks ⇒ **never** evicted and always
/// receiving the latest value.
///
/// The survey found two mechanisms that look alike and are not: NATS evicts a
/// slow consumer, Redis bounds its output buffer, and neither of those is
/// conflation. Ours does both, at two different thresholds, and the interesting
/// object is the **boundary** between them rather than either side of it. A
/// case that asserted only the eviction would pass on a gateway that had
/// forgotten how to conflate; a case that asserted only the conflation would
/// pass on a gateway that had forgotten how to evict. So both arms live in one
/// case, over one fixture, on one set of thresholds, differing only in how fast
/// the plant produces — because that is what makes them a pair rather than two
/// cases, and a change that moves the boundary moves one arm across it.
///
/// **What neither row claims, and it matters.** Neither arm observes a *client*
/// backlog, because there is no such observable: `dart:io`'s WebSocket exposes
/// no `bufferedAmount` and no flush completion (flutter#103306), `sink.add`
/// never blocks, and 07-RESEARCH §B.3 measured 700 KB "sent" onto a 100 kbit/s
/// link returning in 5 ms with zero bytes received. What
/// `ConflatingSendBuffer.poll` measures across ticks is therefore this client's
/// own **production** — how many distinct handles changed for it between two
/// ticks — and not how far behind it has fallen (STATE.md 03-REVIEW WR-11, and
/// `send_buffer.dart:180-200` says it in the same words). Nobody should read
/// G5's green as evidence that the gateway can see how far behind a panel is.
/// It cannot, and the eviction it performs is a judgement about the *plant's*
/// rate for that page, taken on the panel's behalf.
///
/// **Why the throttle is the in-process proxy and not `tc netem`.**
/// 07-RESEARCH §B.1: the netem command builder in this repository has no
/// bytes-per-second rate, netem is Linux-only in CI and needs privilege, and
