/// F16 — Client suspend/resume.
///
/// The catalogue's expectation, verbatim: on resume: detects staleness
/// immediately, reconnects or resyncs;
/// no burst of queued stale timers acting on dead state
/// (generation counter again).
///
/// **The lever is `Isolate.pause()`, and the deviation is only in the
/// spelling.** The catalogue names `SIGSTOP` on the client process for 30 s and
/// then `SIGCONT`. In-process that is not expressible — a stopped process
/// cannot run the assertions — and a child process driven by
/// `Process.killPid(ProcessSignal.sigstop)` is unavailable on Windows, so the
/// row would be green on two platforms and skipped on the third. A paused
/// isolate stops its event loop, so its socket is not read, bytes pile up in
/// the kernel, its timers do not fire and the gateway stops hearing from it:
/// every observable `SIGSTOP` produces, produced by an API with no platform
/// story. See `test/support/suspend_harness.dart`.
///
/// **The first case in this file is that claim being re-measured rather than
/// cited.** 07-RESEARCH §A.4 executed the probe on macOS arm64 only, and its
/// own assumption A3 says Linux and Windows are *assumed* identical because it
/// is a VM-level API. The probe therefore ships as an arm that runs wherever
/// the lane runs. It carries **no skip**: a platform on which `Isolate.pause`
/// does not stop the event loop must make this lane red and say so, not green
/// by omission. A skip would leave F16 below reading as a judged row on a
/// platform where its lever does nothing — which is the "capability switched
/// off" failure the manifest's skip audit exists to catch one level up. If that
/// red ever arrives, the fallback is a child process under
/// `ProcessSignal.sigstop` with a *named* Windows skip, and the probe's failure
/// message says so.
///
/// **The no-burst clause is the VM's property, not the client's, and the row
/// says so out loud.** 07-RESEARCH §A.4 measured Dart coalescing overdue
/// periodic timers rather than replaying them: an isolate paused for 600 ms
/// with a 20 ms timer produced 0 ticks across the pause and then resumed at its
/// ordinary rate, never 30 ticks at once. So "no burst of queued stale timers
/// acting on dead state" is delivered here by the runtime. The row asserts it
/// anyway, because the regression it would catch is real — a client that
/// hand-rolled catch-up, or a future timer wrapper that replayed missed periods
/// — but nobody should read this green as evidence of a client mechanism that
/// does not exist. The generation counter the catalogue names in the same
/// breath *is* a client mechanism and it is gated by F3
/// (`flap_gate_test.dart`), where a half-finished session's callbacks are the
/// subject.
///
/// **What is measured across the pause, and why it is a push.** The panel
/// pushes a report on each of its own ticks. A paused isolate sends nothing, so
/// "zero reports arrived across twenty-nine seconds" is an observation rather
/// than an inference, and there is no poll racing the pause. The tick counter
/// inside those reports is the panel's own, counted in the panel's isolate,
/// which is the only counter that stops when that event loop does.
