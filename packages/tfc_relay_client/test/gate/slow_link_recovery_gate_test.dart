/// **The same page as F19, and the oversubscription is measured rather than

/// measured what it actually costs on this build: **281 kbit/s**, not the
/// ~0.58 Mbit/s the catalogue estimates. So this link is **2.8x**
/// oversubscribed and not the 5.8x F20's injection line predicts, and every
/// band below is derived from the measured number. A band derived from 5.8
/// would be a band about a page this repository does not produce.
///
/// **What F20 and F21 deliberately do not assert, and where those clauses
/// went.** Four of F20's clauses are asserted below. Two are not, and both are
/// in `f_row_registry.dart`'s `gateDeviations` with the measurement that put
/// them there rather than being weakened until they passed:
///
///  * **"queue stays bounded"** — as a claim about the *socket*. The §7.6
///    design rule it rests on is to drain the conflating map only once the
///    previous write actually completed, and 07-RESEARCH §B.3 measured that
///    there is no such signal: 700 KB pushed onto a 100 kbit/s link returned
///    in 5 ms with zero bytes received and RSS up 2.9 MB, on both `sink.add`
///    and `await sink.addStream`. So the drain is not gated on egress, the
///    backlog lives in `dart:io`'s own outgoing buffer, and this process
///    cannot see it. What clause 4 below asserts is the **conflating map**,
///    which is a different queue, and it says so on the assertion.
///  * **`PIPE.link_degraded` + `PIPE.effective_hz` … an AlarmMan alarm
///    fires** — the health keys ship with upstream fan-in (Phase 8) and there
///    is no AlarmMan wiring in the pipe. Clause 3 is the operator-visible half
///    of that clause built out of what exists: a starved page renders stale.
///  * **"never an old queued one"** across ticks. The conflating map collapses
///    changes *within* one tick, and F20 measures that: 12 update frames
///    delivered against 35 sweeps during the metered window. What it also
///    measures is that the frames one tick apart are not collapsed at all —
///    115 of 116 sweeps eventually reached the panel, because each drained
///    frame is committed to the socket the moment it is built and the meter
///    only decides when it arrives. Ordering, within-tick latest-wins and
///    convergence on the current value are asserted; a claim that the queue
///    between ticks was discarded is not, and the number is in the registry.
///  * **F21's "no burst of backlogged frames on recovery"**, which is measured
///    to be false: 107 update frames and 376 kB in the first second after the
///    meter cleared, against a steady state of 10.0/s. The band was written
///    first, at half again the steady state, and it went red. It was not
///    widened — see the burst paragraph on that case and the registry entry
///    carrying both numbers.
///
/// A protocol-level ack that would make the drain gateable is a named
/// follow-up (07-CONTEXT user ruling 1), not built here.
///
/// **Why the throttle is the in-process proxy and not `tc netem`.**
/// 07-RESEARCH §B.1, and `slow_link_gate_test.dart` argues it at length: the
/// netem builder here has no bytes-per-second rate, netem is Linux-only in CI
