/// **F18 — Duplicate/stale frames after reconnect.** Scripted server sends
/// old-epoch `values` after resync. The catalogue asks that the client discards
/// frames from a previous connection epoch — epoch/generation id in the
/// protocol, asserted here.
///
/// Two arms, and they are two different staleness questions. The first replays
/// a frame inside one establishment: the sequence number has moved on and the
/// old frame must not be applied behind it. The second replays a frame from
/// *before* a reconnect, which is the harder half — a resync restarts the
/// sequence at the gateway's snapshot, so without a per-subscription generation
/// a pre-drop frame is byte-indistinguishable from the first frame of the
/// session that replaced it. 04-REVIEW CR-04 minted `g` for exactly this, and
/// the second arm is the deviation that recorded the gap converted into an
/// assertion.
///
/// Both frames are captured off the wire rather than hand-written: F18 is about
/// a frame the gateway genuinely sent, and a stand-in would assert against a
/// shape somebody guessed.
///
/// Moved here verbatim from `test/contract/fault_contract_test.dart` in Phase 7
/// (07-02); bodies unchanged.
///
/// **G4 — Seq gap across a generation change**, added in 07-06, beside the F18
/// arms it shares a fixture with. §D.1's row: a subscribe-on-existing-id
/// re-establish drops the old send-buffer lane; assert a frame from generation
/// *g* arriving after the snapshot for *g+1* is discarded, and that the client
/// does **not** count it as a gap and resync again.
///
/// **What makes it G4 rather than a third F18.** F18b's replayed frame is from
/// before a *reconnect*, and its sequence is whatever the old session left it
/// with; either guard could be the one that stops it. G4 chooses the sequence
/// the next genuine frame would carry, so the sequence check would have
/// **accepted** it and only the generation guard can reject it — and the
/// re-establish is on the **same socket**, which is the hazard 04-REVIEW CR-04
/// minted the generation for and the one an epoch cannot see. 07-04 measured
/// that no socket-killing fault can reach it: under `flap(200ms, 200ms)` the
/// peer is retired before an in-flight frame can arrive, so both guards fired
/// zero times across a ten-second flap and F3's case stayed green with both of
/// them deleted. This case is where that clause gets asserted, which is why F3
/// carried a partial entry naming 07-06 as its owner.
///
/// The lever for the same-socket re-establish is a sequence gap, because that
/// is the one a case can pull without a scripted gateway: `BatchSeqGap` sends
/// the resync engine to `_resubscribe`, the gateway re-establishes the page in
/// place (`session_handlers.dart:147-176`), and the generation moves while the
/// session, the socket and the epoch all stay exactly where they were.
