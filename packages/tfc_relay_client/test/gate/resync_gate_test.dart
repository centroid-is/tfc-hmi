/// resync is complete and consistent; no key left with pre-first-drop value.
/// The operative half is the last clause: **every** key on the page, not the one
/// key the case happens to watch. A single-key page has no burst to interrupt
/// and no "every", which is why `resync_test.dart`'s in-memory arms cannot make
/// this row's claim.
///
/// **G3 — Resync storm / gap thrash.** The industry survey's version of the same
/// worry (07-RESEARCH-PUBSUB §D.1): induce repeated sequence gaps and assert
/// resyncs are **coalesced, not stacked** — one in-flight resync per
/// subscription, backoff not reset until it completes, no unbounded growth.
/// Sparkplug's rebirth and Ably's re-attach both rate-limit for this reason and
/// OPC UA Part 14 caps discovery responses at five times the KeepAliveTime;
/// ours has no stated limit, so the coalescing in `resync_engine.dart` is the
/// whole of the protection and nothing asserted it.
///
/// **What the resync of one page actually looks like on the wire, measured.**
/// A 40-key page recovers in **two inbound frames**: the `hello` answer (280 b)
/// and then the whole snapshot as a single 4275-byte response, 49 ms later. The
/// "burst" of the catalogue's phrase is not a stream of frames at this layer —
/// one subscription is one snapshot in one frame however large the page — so
/// the interruptible window is *between* those two frames: the session is
/// re-established, the client has asked for the page, and the answer has not
/// arrived. That is where F9's second kill is armed, and the case measures both
/// numbers on every run rather than trusting this paragraph.
///
/// **Neither case reaches into `_inFlight`.** The property the plant cares about
/// is how many times the *gateway* was asked to rebuild the page, so the count
/// is read from the gateway's own registry and corroborated against the
/// subscribe answers on the wire. A case that read the private map would assert
