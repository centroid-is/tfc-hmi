/// F2 and F3: the link that will not stay up.
///
/// **F2 — Dropout every other second.** `flap(1s, 1s)` for 60 s. The catalogue
/// asks for no crash, no unbounded memory/log growth,
/// no reconnect storm (backoff caps attempt rate); UI shows disconnected —
/// never flickers stale values as fresh during the 1 s up-windows unless
/// resync completed.
///
/// **F3 — Fast flap, shorter than handshake.** `flap(200ms, 200ms)`. The
/// catalogue asks that
/// reconnect attempts that never complete subscribe are discarded cleanly;
/// generation counter (§7.2) prevents a half-finished session's callbacks
/// touching state.
///
/// **F3 covers the first of those clauses and measurably cannot reach the
/// second, which is a finding rather than a shortfall.** The plan this case was
/// written from expected the generation counter — proven in memory at
/// `resync_test.dart:255` against a scripted peer — to be driven here over a
/// real socket. It is not, and the measurement is unambiguous: temporary probes
/// inside both guards in `resync_engine.onUpdate` fired **0** times across a
/// ten-second `flap(200ms, 200ms)` and **2** times in `resync_test.dart`, and
/// this case stayed green with *both* the epoch guard and the generation guard
/// deleted. The reason is structural. A flap kills the socket, so the
/// supervisor retires the peer (`connection_supervisor.dart:_retirePeer`) and
/// there is no handler left for an in-flight frame to arrive at — nothing needs
/// discarding because nothing is delivered. The generation counter's hazard is
/// a **same-socket** re-establish, where a server-announced resync or a
/// gap-triggered resubscribe rebuilds one page while the session stays put
/// (04-REVIEW CR-04, and the reason the epoch cannot do the job). That is row
/// G4, and `gateOutstanding` carries F3 as a **partial** owned by 07-06 with
/// this measurement in it.
///
/// What F3 does prove over a real socket, and what nothing else in the tree
/// does: an establishment that is genuinely cut between its socket and its
/// snapshot leaves no value in the cache, no subscription half-registered on
/// the gateway, and no complaint about a page the client believes is live.
///
/// **Three F2 arms, and each of them exists because the other two cannot say
/// what it says.**
///
/// `F2a` is the operator's scenario at the phase's declared duration: twenty
/// seconds of dropping every other second, with the storm bound, the log-flood
/// ceiling, the structural counts and the honesty arm. It runs on every
/// platform, which is why the descriptor clause is **not** in it: the only
/// spelling of "this platform cannot count descriptors" that package:test
/// offers is a skip on the whole case, and a whole-case Windows skip would take
/// the storm bound, the log ceiling and the honesty arm off the Windows column
/// behind a reason that mentions only file descriptors. That is precisely the
/// failure `gate_manifest_test.dart`'s skip audit exists to catch — a green
/// tick and a skipped tick look the same, and the reason is the only thing that
/// tells them apart.
///
/// `F2b` is therefore the descriptor clause on its own, Windows-skipped by name
/// with `openSocketCountSkipReason`, which then says exactly what stopped being
/// judged there because it is *all* that arm judges. It runs a shorter window
/// on purpose: the leak criterion is a **rate per establish/teardown cycle**
/// (`teardown_test.dart:330-375`), so cycles are its unit and seconds are not,
/// and five cycles show a per-cycle leak as clearly as ten at half the cost.
///
/// `F2c` is the catalogue's own sixty seconds, behind `RELAY_SOAK`. It is the
/// same function as `F2a` with a longer window — literally the same, so "same
/// assertions" is a fact about the code rather than a claim in a comment. The
/// shortened default is declared in `gateDeviations` (07-CONTEXT user ruling 2)
/// rather than quietly applied.
///
/// **What is asserted about the flap is asserted over a window, never at an
/// instant.** `fault_proxy.dart:359-363` measured a connect attempt completing
/// on the far side of a transition, so a flag read at assertion time does not
/// describe what the connection experienced. Every number below is a count, a
/// delta between checkpoints, or a bound.
///
/// **`seam.inbound` is cleared at every checkpoint, and its length is carried
/// forward as a running total** (07-RESEARCH trap 15). `FrameSeam` retains
/// every inbound frame as a `String`; twenty seconds of ticks left accumulating
/// would make this case the unbounded memory growth it is asserting against.
/// The count is what the case wants; the strings are not.
