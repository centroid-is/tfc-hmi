/// The two kinds of "not fresh", kept apart and proved apart.

/// Source: 04-RESEARCH Finding 5 — **121 tick notifications in 7001 ms**, with
/// wire-measured inter-tick deltas `[51, 50, 50, 49, 50, 51, …]`, dead flat at
/// **50.0 ms** over 121 samples, and **zero update frames** in that window
/// because nothing in the plant changed. Two things follow, and both are
/// asserted below rather than assumed.
///
/// First, the tick alone is the liveness signal, so a watchdog that only
/// counted *updates* would call a quiet plant dead. Second — and this is why
/// every deadline in this file is written as a multiple of an **injected**
/// period and never as a millisecond count copied from the wire — reading
/// CLI-04's "3× tick" against that measured 50 ms cadence yields a 150 ms
/// deadline. One garbage collection pause on the panel, or one Wi-Fi
/// retransmit on the plant WAN, and every value on the screen greys out at
/// once while the gateway is perfectly healthy. The operator learns within a
/// week that grey means nothing, and the freshness indicator — the whole
/// product — is dead. So the deadline is configured, defaulting to 3 s, and
/// what these cases pin is the **ratio**: stale at three times whatever period
/// the client was told to expect.
///
/// The other half is F25, the dead subscription on a live socket
/// (04-RESEARCH Finding 3): ticks keep arriving, the link is provably up, and
/// one subscription's `evaluatedAt` has stopped advancing because its
/// plant-side source stopped evaluating. Without the per-sub group below, that
/// value renders as current forever — a socket that is up is not a promise
/// that the number on the screen is. And the client must never "fix" it by
/// resyncing: the stream is fine, the plant is not, and a resync loop against
/// a healthy gateway is how one dead PLC tag takes out the whole panel.
