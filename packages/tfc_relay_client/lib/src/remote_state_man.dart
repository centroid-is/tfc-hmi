/// The `StateManApi` a panel holds: the same shape as `ChannelStateMan`, with
/// the four things that file deliberately omits wired around it.
///
/// `channel_state_man.dart:11-16` says outright that it was written as a
/// rehearsal for this class — "same store, same synchronous-answers-from-cache
/// shape, same `subscribe` adapter over the same node. What it is missing is
/// everything a socket forces — reconnect, resync, sequence gaps and
/// per-request deadlines". This file is that class with the missing four
/// supplied, so it is a copy where it can be (including the comments, because
/// the comments are the reasoning) and different only where a socket makes it
/// different. Those differences, in full:
///
///  1. **No connection at construction.** The shared contract suite calls
///     `StateManApi Function() make` synchronously (04-RESEARCH Finding 6), so
///     there is nothing to await in a constructor. `_peer` is therefore not a
///     field here at all: it is owned by [ConnectionSupervisor], swapped on
///     every reconnect, and read through [ConnectionSupervisor.peer] at the
///     moment of each call. That constraint is also the right production shape
///     — a panel boots with the rest of the line, and a client that threw at
///     power-on would put the plant's start-up order in the operator's hands.
///
///  2. **Every async method waits on the readiness barrier.** `read`, `listen`,
///     `keys` and `subscribe` do not: they are cache reads by design
///     (`state_man_api.dart:90-96`, "synchronous and never a round trip"), and
///     a page that blocked on the socket before it could paint would be grey at
///     exactly the moment an operator needs to see the last known value marked
///     stale.
///
///  3. **Handler registration is per connection, not per client.** In
///     `ChannelStateMan` the `registerMethod` block lives in the constructor
///     because there is one `Peer` for life. A fresh `Peer` per socket means
///     fresh registrations per socket, so that block lives in the supervisor's
///     per-connection setup and not here.
///
///  4. **Every request carries a deadline** (`deadline.dart`), and every
///     failure goes through one classifier (`failure_taxonomy.dart`). A closed
///     transport is reported by `json_rpc_2` as a `StateError`, so a call site
///     that caught only `RpcException` would never see the link die.
///
/// **One store per subscription, and why this class owns the map.** A
/// `ValueStore` holds a single sequence counter, so N subscriptions sharing one
/// store rebuild client-side the false-gap hazard the server refuses
/// server-side (04-04). The supervisor takes `subscriptions` and `storeFor` by
/// reference and never invents an entry — page lifecycle is this class's, which
/// is why the maps live here and the supervisor only re-establishes what it is
/// given.
///
/// **This class owns the panel's one pinned `HttpClient`**, which is what
/// makes it `dart:io`-only — the same price `ws_transport.dart` pays and for
/// the same reason: a `SecurityContext` can only be handed to a dial through
/// an `HttpClient`, and SEC-02 is that context. It is built once here, closed
/// over by the default dial, and closed in [RemoteStateMan.dispose]; a fresh
/// one per attempt would re-parse the mounted root and leak a connection pool
/// on every reconnect, on the one path that only runs when something is
/// already wrong.
///
/// What breaks in the plant without this file: nothing on a panel can read a
/// tag. It is the whole client surface.
