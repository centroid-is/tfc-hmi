/// One seam decides whether a failed call means "we do not know" or "the
/// server said no".
///
/// Source: 04-RESEARCH Finding 1, four experiments executed against
/// `json_rpc_2` 4.1.0:
///
/// | Situation | Observed outcome | Exact type |
/// |---|---|---|
/// | Request in flight, transport closes under it | rejects | `StateError: Bad state: The client closed with pending request "neverAnswered".` |
/// | Same, but the close came from a real `killOnce` through FaultProxy | rejects, identical message | `StateError: Bad state: The client closed with pending request "subscribe".` |
/// | Response arrives carrying a **different id** | never settles — still pending after 400 ms | (eternal hang) |
/// | `sendRequest` called after the peer is already closed | throws | `StateError: Bad state: The client is closed.` |
///
/// Two consequences, and the second one is why this file exists.
///
/// **`on RpcException` misses connection loss entirely.** The library reports
/// a lost link as a `StateError`, so a call site that catches only
/// `RpcException` never sees it, and one that treats every caught error as a
/// server answer gets the verdict exactly backwards.
///
/// **The verdicts are opposites in the plant.** *Rejected* means the machine
/// did not move: the operator reads the reason, changes something, tries
/// again. *Unknown* means nobody knows: the operator has to walk out and look
/// at the equipment before touching anything. Report a lost link as a refusal
/// and you have told someone a valve definitely did not open when it may well
/// have opened. Report a genuine interlock refusal as unknown and you send a
/// fitter across the factory for nothing — which is how a plant learns to
/// ignore the warning, and then ignores the real one.
///
/// **The trap underneath** (Finding 1 note 3): `StateError` is also what a
/// plain programming error looks like, and the message string is the only
/// thing that tells them apart. So the match lives in exactly one predicate,
/// [isLinkLossMessage], deliberately narrow, and anything it does not
/// recognise is rethrown. A bare `on StateError` at this seam would swallow
/// our own defect *and* report it to the operator as a plant condition.
///
/// **Nothing here re-issues a request.** A write is an actuation — a ram, a
/// valve, a diverter — and this side cannot know whether the first one landed.
/// Re-sending is a second actuation, so it is a decision for a human looking
/// at the machine. `taxonomy_test.dart` enforces that over the whole of `lib/`
/// as a CI-run case, not a one-off grep.
