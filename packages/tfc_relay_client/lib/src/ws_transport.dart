/// One connect attempt, and the socket seen as a `StreamChannel<String>` a
/// `Peer` can run over — without the idiom that would lock the write side.
///
/// This is `tfc_relay_server`'s `ws_channel.dart` from the other end of the
/// wire: same `mutedRepublish`, same hand-built sink, both copied whole with
/// their reasoning, plus the one thing only the client needs — a connect that
/// can fail, because the panel dials and the gateway answers.
///
/// **The trap, measured** (03-RESEARCH Finding 1, `ws_channel.dart:4-20`). The
/// documented way to hand a WebSocket to `json_rpc_2` is to cast the whole
/// channel to strings, and it is wrong on both ends of this pipe. Casting a
/// channel does not just retype the two halves: it binds the underlying sink
/// with `addStream` and keeps it bound for the connection's whole life, so
/// every later writer gets
///
/// ```text
/// Bad state: Cannot add event while adding stream.
/// package:stream_channel/src/guarantee_channel.dart:121
/// ```
///
/// "Later writer" is exact, and worth being exact about: measured on this
/// side, a single writer going through the cast channel is fine — the cast
/// pipes its frames through the one `addStream` it owns. What throws is the
/// **second** writer, the one that reaches past the channel at the socket. On
/// the gateway that is the fan-out tick; on the panel it is the app-level
/// heartbeat the supervisor sends around the `Peer` (STACK: Flutter web cannot
/// send ping frames, so liveness is an application frame), and anything else
/// the supervisor needs to say without going through the RPC layer. Nothing
/// warns at compile time and nothing fails at startup — the panel connects,
/// shows values, and the first beat of its own liveness check throws. So: cast
/// the **stream**, which is a cheap view, and build the sink by hand.
///
/// **Connect failure is a value, not a throw** (04-RESEARCH Finding 2,
/// executed). A dial at a dead port surfaces as
///
/// ```text
/// WebSocketChannelException: WebSocketChannelException: SocketException:
/// Connection refused (errno 61)
/// ```
///
/// from **both** `ws.ready` and the stream, with `closeCode == null` — there
/// was never a connection, so there is no code. This file awaits `ready`
/// inside a try and returns a [ConnectFailed] carrying the exception, and it
/// drains the second copy so that it does not land on the isolate's ambient
/// handler and get attributed to whichever test case runs next. A gateway that
/// is not up yet is the *normal* state of a panel at power-on, and a reconnect
/// loop that dies on its first attempt leaves the screen grey until somebody
/// drives to the factory.
///
/// **Close codes are data here, and policy nowhere** (Finding 2's caveat).
/// Driving a protocol mismatch against the real gateway showed
/// `closeCode = 4005`, but a `killOnce` through the fault proxy showed
/// `closeCode = 1002` with an empty reason — a yanked link is
/// indistinguishable-by-code from a protocol error. The rule the supervisor
/// follows, stated here because this is where the code is observed: 4001–4005
/// are advisory, 4005 stops the retry loop, and **everything else — 1002, 1006
/// and null included — means the link went away, retry**. Nothing in this file
/// branches on the number, and nothing in it reads `readyState` for liveness
/// either (STACK: `readyState` lies after an OS sleep).
