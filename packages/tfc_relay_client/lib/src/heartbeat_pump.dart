/// The app heartbeat: the one periodic frame this client owes the gateway.
///
/// **Why it exists.** The gateway's reaper closes any session that has gone
/// longer than its `heartbeatDeadline` without an inbound *application* frame
/// (`relay_session.dart`'s `_lastSeen`, `tick_engine.dart`'s `reap`). A panel
/// that is only watching a page — which is what every panel in the plant does,
/// all shift — sends nothing after its handshake. Before this file existed the
/// consequence was measured on an idle single-panel fixture: **three reaps and
/// three redials in twenty-one seconds**, each one a full page resync, on every
/// panel in the factory, invisible from outside because the panel comes
/// straight back (07-08-SUMMARY deviation 3; `deferred-items.md` carries the
/// mechanism).
///
/// The design ruled on this at inception and CLAUDE.md still carries the
/// sentence: *"no browser ping frames — **server pings + app heartbeat**"*.
/// WebSocket ping/pong is not available to us as liveness — it is a
/// socket-level keepalive that `shelf` owns, a pong is not an application
/// frame, and Flutter web cannot send one at all. So the heartbeat is an
/// ordinary `ping` request, at the application layer, from here.
///
/// **Why a separate file, and the pin that goes with it.**
/// `no_retry_test.dart` pins `remote_state_man.dart` at zero `Timer(` — the
/// write path must schedule nothing of its own, because the only thing there
/// is to schedule about an unanswered write is sending it again. That pin is
/// not loosened. The heartbeat lives here instead, behind a **named carve-out**
/// in the same file: this file may hold exactly one `Timer.periodic(`, and its
/// send site may name `Methods.ping` and nothing else. A pump that could send
/// anything else would be a second, unbookkept way for a frame to reach the
/// plant, which is precisely what the write-path pins exist to forbid.
///
/// **Listener-gated, and that phrase is load-bearing here.** The timer exists
/// only while the link is `ready`: it is created on entry and cancelled on
/// exit, so an idle client, a disconnected client and a disposed client all
/// hold zero timers. A pump that ran unconditionally would keep a process alive
/// and would fail unrelated widget tests the moment this client reaches
/// Flutter — the discipline STATE.md records as "timers must be listener-gated".
///
/// **A gate, never a buffer, and never a `try`/`catch` for the gate.** This is
/// `HoldToRunController`'s discipline (05-07), restated because the failure it
/// prevents is the same one: `sendRequest` on a closed peer throws
/// `StateError` synchronously and `failure_taxonomy.dart` deliberately rethrows
/// unrecognised `StateError`s, so a `catch` around the send would swallow a
/// real defect in this process along with the condition it meant to ignore.
/// Every send is preceded by an explicit readiness check and an explicit
/// null-peer check. A beat that cannot go out is **dropped**, never stored: a
/// queued heartbeat is a lie about a moment that has passed, and `_WsSink.add`
/// buffers without bound and reports nothing (flutter#103306).
