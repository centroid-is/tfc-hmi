/// Whether the panel is still hearing from the gateway at all — one deadline
/// for the whole link, restarted by anything that arrives on it.
///
/// Source: 04-RESEARCH Finding 5. The gateway's fan-out was measured at a dead
/// flat **50.0 ms** — 121 tick notifications in 7001 ms, inter-tick deltas
/// `[51, 50, 50, 49, 50, 51, …]`, no drift, no outliers — with a production
/// default period of 100 ms, and **zero update frames** in that window because
/// nothing in the plant changed. The tick alone is the liveness signal.
///
/// **Why no number here is derived from that measurement.** Reading CLI-04's
/// "3× tick" literally against the measured cadence gives a 150–300 ms
/// deadline, and then one garbage collection pause on the panel, or one Wi-Fi
/// retransmit on the plant WAN, greys every value on the screen at once while
/// the gateway is perfectly healthy. Grey that cries wolf is grey the operator
/// stops reading. So the *link* deadline is [ClientConfig.freshnessDeadline] —
/// a configured duration, default 3 s — and nothing derives it from the
/// transport cadence.
///
/// The cadence itself the client does now learn: `hello` advertises
/// `capabilities.tickMs` (it returned `capabilities: {}` when Finding 5
/// measured it; the gateway has sent it since 04-06). [learnedTickMs] takes
/// it, and it is consumed in exactly one place for exactly one purpose — the
/// *per-subscription* limit, which is a statement about how often the plant
/// re-evaluates a page rather than about how long the socket may go quiet.
/// Confusing the two is what 04-REVIEW WR-08 was.
///
/// **One timer, not one per subscription** (Finding 5's timer discipline). N
/// timers on a 1500-key page is N cancellations to get right on every
/// reconnect, and the one that is missed fires into a torn-down page. And the
/// reset comes from frames, never from socket state: `readyState` lies after
/// an OS sleep (STACK), so liveness is what arrived, not what the socket says
/// about itself.
///
/// What breaks in the plant without this file: silence is ambiguous. A socket
/// half-opened over a sleeping NAT looks exactly like a quiet plant, and the
/// operator reads a five-minute-old tank level as current. Freshness is the
/// product.
///
/// ---
///
/// **The second half — the subscriptions, and no timers at all.** [sawTick]
/// records each `SubTick.evaluatedAt` and subtracts; nothing in that half
/// schedules anything. It exists for F25 (04-RESEARCH Finding 3), the dead
/// subscription on a live socket: ticks keep arriving, the link is provably
/// up, and one subscription's plant-side source has stopped evaluating. The
/// link watchdog above cannot see that — every frame it needs is still
/// landing — so a value the PLC stopped producing would render as current
/// forever.
///
/// That fault is **the plant's, not the stream's** (the 04-CONTEXT ruling), so
/// per-subscription staleness never triggers a resync. This class has no
/// collaborator it could ask and no way to express the request: tearing down a
/// healthy subscription set because one tag went quiet is how a single dead
/// PLC point takes out an entire panel, repeatedly, for as long as the tag
/// stays dead.
///
/// The two halves keep separate state and separate methods because CLI-04's
/// entire point is that the operator can tell three states apart: the link is
/// gone, this one value is not being evaluated, everything is fine.
///
/// **Whose clock.** Per-subscription age is measured in the *gateway's* time,
/// never the panel's. On a tick that is free — `TickParams.serverTime` and
/// `SubTick.evaluatedAt` are both server wall-clock epoch ms, verified live in
/// 04-RESEARCH Finding 5b. Between ticks, [FreshnessWatchdog.staleSubscriptionsAt]
/// converts the caller's local instant into server time with the offset
/// captured at hello (`ClockOffset` in `clock_offset.dart`, whose `toServer`
/// this mirrors: `offset = localNow - hello.serverTime`). A panel whose own
/// clock is ten minutes wrong is a panel with a wrong clock, not a plant with
/// 1500 dead tags — CLI-05 says warn and keep showing values.
