///
/// Source: 04-RESEARCH Finding 2, whose state table is this file's spec:
///
/// | State | Entered when | Backoff |
/// |---|---|---|
/// | `connecting` | an attempt starts | — |
/// | `resyncing` | socket up, hello answered, subscriptions re-establishing | **not** reset |
/// | `ready` | every subscription has its snapshot | **reset** |
/// | `down` | the attempt failed, or an established link dropped | next attempt scheduled |
///
/// **The one line CLI-02 is about.** The schedule is put back to its
/// attempt-0 window on entry to `ready` and nowhere else. A gateway that
/// accepts sockets and closes them before the snapshot lands is exactly the
/// flap that bites: reset on entry to `resyncing` and every panel in the
/// factory redials from the same 40 ms window, in a wave, against a gateway
/// still replaying snapshots for the previous wave. The herd is
/// self-sustaining — the synchronised retry is what keeps the gateway too busy
/// to finish, which is what keeps the retries synchronised — so the rule is
/// that a link earns its forgiveness by *delivering a snapshot*, not by
/// answering the phone. `reconnect_test.dart`'s
/// `a server that closes before the snapshot does not earn a reset` is the arm
/// that fails the wrong version; every happy-path reconnect case passes under
/// it, which is why that one arm exists.
///
/// **Nothing here reads a close code.** Finding 2 drove a protocol mismatch
/// against the real gateway and saw 4005, then drove a `killOnce` through the
/// fault proxy and saw **1002 with an empty reason** — a yanked cable is
/// indistinguishable-by-code from a protocol error. So the stop decision is
/// taken from the thing that actually carries meaning: the gateway *answered*
/// the handshake and refused it by version. Everything else — a cut cable, a
/// 4002 drain, a socket that ends with no code at all — means the link went
/// away, and the answer to that is always to come back.
///
/// **A fresh peer per connection, and one teardown for both ends of it.** The
/// lifecycle half is `tfc_relay_server`'s `relay_session.dart:418-440`, copied
/// with its reasoning: `listen()` is routed to the same teardown on completion
/// *and* on error, because the server's 03-11 defect was a completion path
/// that released the connection without ever running the teardown, measured at
/// 2.50 leaked listeners per kill cycle. The client does this on every
/// reconnect attempt, and a panel whose gateway is rebooting does it for as
/// long as the reboot takes.
///
/// **Handlers are born with armor.** Every notification body and the fallback
/// carry the pre-substituted `data` from `relay_session.dart:521-526`. Echoing
/// a request that may hold a non-finite number is what makes the *error*
/// unencodable, and an unencodable error hangs every error path on that peer
/// (STATE line 77, the 02-05 trap).
///
/// What breaks in the plant without this file: the panel connects once and
/// never again. A gateway restart at shift change leaves every screen in the
/// control room grey until somebody walks around power-cycling them.
