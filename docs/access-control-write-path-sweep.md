# Write-path sweep — every path from Dart code to a persistent store

## 1. What this is, and why it exists

`docs/access-control-spec.md` §6 lists the write paths that reach a store
without passing `StateMan.write` or `PreferencesApi.set*` — the two interfaces
the Phase 3 guards wrap. It was written as three. A fourth of exactly the same
shape, the history view's Drift deletes, had been sitting in the tree the whole
time and was found during Phase 2 only because somebody read the ungated-routes
list and checked one claim. §6 is now amended to four and says outright: assume
there is a fifth. A guard beside an unenumerated hole is the decorative outcome
§6 exists to prevent, and this phase's failure mode is the silent one — a guard
that misses a write path looks identical to one that covers it, from every
screen, forever.

This document is the enumeration, and the verdict for each site. It is
reproducible: **`bash scripts/sweep-write-paths.sh`** from the repository root
re-runs every search and prints the same list. That script is a report, not a
gate; plan 03-11 turns a subset of its section 4 into a CI check, and plan 03-12
re-runs the whole thing and asserts every hit still has a row here. Sites are
matched by **file and call**, not by line number — line numbers move on every
edit, and a check that fails on reformatting gets deleted rather than fixed.

**Sweep run: 2026-08-29**, over `lib`, `centroid-hmi/lib`, `demo` and
`packages/*/lib`, excluding `test`, `build` and `.dart_tool`.
**Re-run: 2026-08-30** by plan 03-12, against the tree seven plans later. The
per-section hit counts in the headings below carry both numbers where they
differ; every new hit has a row, one row was found to have been missing since
the first run (§4.1 F), and no row was left stale. From that re-run onwards the
comparison is a test — `test/core/phase_03_coverage_test.dart` runs the script
and reconciles its hits against this document's table rows in **both**
directions, by file, so a write path added after today fails a suite rather
than waiting to be read about. The script's own
header records its two output conventions: comment-only lines are dropped (a
comment is not a call, which is why `centroid-hmi/lib/main.dart:449` quoting
`adb.deleteHistoryView` in a note is not a site), and hits inside generated
files are collapsed to a counted line per file rather than listed. Both are
limits on the search and both are restated in §6 below.

**The answer to "is there a fifth?" is yes**, and it is in §4. The largest new
finding is a family the spec never mentions: three raw-Drift index classes in
`packages/tfc_mcp_server`, called directly from the Knowledge Base page, which
Phase 2 deliberately left ungated because it reads as a read surface. Plans
03-13 and 03-14 close it at the controls and at the route; §3.1 records both,
and the operational cost of the second.

---

## 2. The table

The verdict vocabulary is fixed at five terms. Every row carries exactly one;
no row is blank and no row says "probably".

| Verdict | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `guarded by NN-NN` | a plan routes it through a guard. `03-NN` for the plans in this phase; one later row carries `06-03`, which closed §3.3 |
| `route-gated (Phase 2)` | reachable only from a route in `kRaisedRoutes` |
| `not widget-reachable` | provider or core machinery with no path from a widget; the row says which and why the claim holds |
| `correct as-is` | the audit sink, the guards themselves, and the stores' own declarations |
| `left open: <reason>` | found, understood, and deliberately not closed |

Where a file carries many calls of one shape, the row names the shape and lists
the lines, because that is how plan 03-12 compares — by file and call.

### 2.1 Named Drift write helpers on `AppDatabase` (script §1 — 44 hits at the 2026-08-29 run, 54 at the 2026-08-30 re-run)

The ten new hits are plan 03-10's guard, which declares the same five method
names and delegates to them. That is the shape a guard has, and it is why the
count going **up** is the expected outcome of closing a bypass rather than a
regression.

| File and line | Call | Store | Reached from | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `lib/pages/history_view.dart:1155` | `store.deleteHistoryView(v.id)` | `history_view` + cascades | delete-view button on `/advanced/history-view` (**not** raised) | `guarded by 03-10` |
| `lib/pages/history_view.dart:1192` | `store.addHistoryViewPeriod(...)` | `history_view_period` | save-period control on the same page | `guarded by 03-10` |
| `lib/pages/history_view.dart:1237` | `store.deleteHistoryViewPeriod(p.id)` | `history_view_period` | delete-period button | `guarded by 03-10` |
| `lib/pages/history_view.dart:1359` | `store.createHistoryView(...)` | `history_view` | save-as control | `guarded by 03-10` |
| `lib/pages/history_view.dart:1411` | `store.updateHistoryView(...)` | `history_view` | save control | `guarded by 03-10` |
| `lib/core/guarded_history_views.dart:127-179` | the same five names on `HistoryViewStore`, each delegating to `_db.<name>` | `history_view`, `history_view_period` | `historyViewStoreProvider`, from the five controls above | `correct as-is` — this **is** the guard; the check and the row happen here and the delegation below them |
| `packages/tfc_dart/lib/core/database_drift.dart:698, 742, 785, 845, 855, 898, 1116` | the seven method **declarations** | — | — | `correct as-is` (this is the API section 1 searches for; declaring it is not calling it) |
| `packages/tfc_dart/lib/core/database_drift.dart:424-427, 466-476, 506-508` | `m.createTable(<table>)` | schema | drift `Migrator` inside `onUpgrade`/`onCreate` | `not widget-reachable` — a different method of the same name on `Migrator`, called only by drift's migration callback at database open |
| `packages/tfc_mcp_server/lib/src/database/server_database.dart:356-397` | `m.createTable(<table>)` | schema | same, for the MCP server's own database | `not widget-reachable` — same reason |
| `packages/tfc_dart/lib/core/database.dart:930` | `db.updateRetentionPolicy(tableName, retention)` | timescale policy | `Database._applyRetentionPolicy` ← `registerRetentionPolicy` ← `Collector` (`collector.dart:216`) | `not widget-reachable` — no widget calls it; the widget-reachable input is the `collector_config` key, which `03-09` guards |
| `packages/tfc_dart/lib/core/database.dart:1715, 1738` | `db.createTable(tableName, ...)` | timeseries tables | `Database` creating a table on first insert | `not widget-reachable` — driven by a sample arriving, not by a control |

**Both accessors were present, and both moved.** At the first run `:1108` used
`adb` and `:1165` used `dbWrap.db`; the script found both because section 1
searches the *method names*, not a receiver spelling — the exact mistake
`.planning/phases/02-route-gating/deferred-items.md` §4 names. Spec §6 listed
two of these five; all five were here, and plan 03-10 moved all five onto
`store.`, which is why every line number in this block changed between the two
runs and none of the calls did. **This is the reason the reconciliation is by
file and call rather than by line.**

### 2.2 Raw Drift statement API (script §2 — 116 hits at the 2026-08-29 run, 113 at the 2026-08-30 re-run)

| File and line | Call | Store | Reached from | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `lib/core/server_config_db.dart:58` | `db.into(db.flutterPreferences).insertOnConflictUpdate(...)` | `flutter_preferences` | `ServerConfigDb.publish()` ← `lib/pages/server_config.dart:3224` | `guarded by 03-08` |
| `lib/core/server_config_db.dart:85-87` | `(db.delete(db.flutterPreferences)..where(...)).go()` | `flutter_preferences` | `ServerConfigDb.remove()` | `guarded by 03-08` |
| `packages/tfc_dart/lib/core/access/drift_audit_sink.dart:75` | `_db.into(_db.auditEntry).insert(...)` | `audit_entry` | `auditSinkProvider` (`lib/providers/access.dart:104`) | `correct as-is` — append-only and retention-exempt by design; the class doc explains why, and this sweep does not restate it |
| `packages/tfc_mcp_server/lib/src/services/drift_tech_doc_index.dart:65, 230-236, 242, 251-253, 260, 306, 322` | `_db.into(...)`, `_db.delete(...)`, `_db.update(...)` | tech-doc tables | **`lib/tech_docs/tech_doc_upload_service.dart:104, 149, 221-222, 275`**, wired at `lib/providers/tech_doc.dart`, driven by the Knowledge Base page | `guarded by 03-13`, and `route-gated (03-14)` besides — see §3.1 |
| `packages/tfc_mcp_server/lib/src/services/drift_plc_code_index.dart:84, 102, 121, 154, 169, 189, 257-276, 565` | `_db.into(...)`, `_db.delete(...)`, `_db.update(...)` | PLC index tables | **`lib/tech_docs/tech_doc_library_section.dart:1075` (`reindexAsset`) and `:1133` (`deleteAssetIndex`)**, wired at `lib/providers/plc.dart:65` | `guarded by 03-13`, and `route-gated (03-14)` besides — see §3.1 |
| `packages/tfc_mcp_server/lib/src/services/drift_drawing_index.dart:56, 68, 89-97, 219, 232` | `_db.into(...)`, `_db.delete(...)` | drawing tables | `lib/drawings/drawing_upload_service.dart:46, 61, 75`, wired at `lib/providers/drawing.dart:14`; `DrawingUploadDialog` has **no caller in the tree today** | `guarded by 03-13` — reachable in principle, unwired in fact, and guarded either way; the route it would be reached from is `route-gated (03-14)`. See §3.1 |
| `packages/tfc_mcp_server/lib/src/audit/audit_log_service.dart:47, 85` | `_db.into(_auditLog).insert(...)`, `_db.update(_auditLog)` | `audit_log` (MCP's own) | `TfcMcpServer`, which runs **in the HMI process** (`lib/mcp/mcp_bridge_notifier.dart:266`, `lib/mcp/mcp_sse_server.dart:56`) | `left open: reached over MCP, not from a widget` — see §3.2 |
| `lib/core/access_template_store.dart:286, 324, 383, 439-441, 498, 531-533` | `_db.into(...).insert` / `.insertOnConflictUpdate`, `_db.update(...)`, `_db.delete(...)` on the two v7 tables | `access_template`, `access_key_binding` | `AccessTemplateStore`, driven by the key repository (04-07, 04-08) and by accepted MCP proposals (04-09) | `correct as-is` — this **is** the guard; `kAccessTemplateGroup` (`users`) is checked and the audit row written above every one of these, over **both** tables. The binding lives in its own table rather than in the `configure`-gated key-mapping blob precisely so the gate is true of the data (ruled 2026-08-30, reversing spec §7b) |
| `lib/pages/access_templates_section.dart:635, 1130` | `store.update(...)`, `store.delete(...)` | `access_template` | `AccessTemplatesSection`, mounted in `KeyRepositoryContent` (04-07) | `correct as-is` — these are calls **on `AccessTemplateStore`**, one row above, not on a database: the `users` gate and the audit row are inside them. Caught by the deliberately broad `.update(`/`.delete(` grep and recorded rather than filtered away, which is the point of the grep being broad. The section writes no binding at all — `bind`/`unbind` are 04-08's, per key |
| `packages/tfc_dart/lib/core/access/access_repository.dart:358, 373, 412, 545, 552-554, 590, 645, 722, 754-755, 781, 814` | `db.into/update/delete` on `app_role` / `app_user` | roles and users | `accessAdminStoreProvider` (06-04), which wraps `accessRepositoryProvider`; and `lib/pages/first_user.dart:141` for the first-user window alone | `guarded by 06-03` — `AccessAdminStore` asks `kAccessAdminGroup` (`users`) and writes a row, refusals included, above every one of the eight writes that reach these statements. The repository is not decorated: it owns the transaction and the last-`users`-holder invariant that must be evaluated inside it — see §3.3 |
| `packages/tfc_dart/lib/core/preferences.dart:210, 254, 428` | `secureStorage.delete(key:)`, `db.customInsert(...)`, `database!.db.customUpdate(...)` | secure store, `flutter_preferences` | inside `Preferences` — the implementation `GuardedPreferences` wraps | `correct as-is` — these are the store the guard decorates; the check happens above them |
| `lib/core/preferences.dart:54-84` | `_prefs.setBool/setInt/setDouble/setString/setStringList/remove/clear` | device-local | `SharedPreferencesWrapper implements PreferencesApi` | `correct as-is` — pure delegation with the caller's key |
| `packages/tfc_dart/lib/core/database_drift.dart:374, 394, 444-527, 702-790, 847-856, 907, 990-1007, 1127-1317` | `into(...)`, `delete(...)`, `customStatement`, `customInsert` | every table | the database's own methods and migrations | `correct as-is` — this file *is* the store |
| `packages/tfc_dart/lib/core/database.dart:1127, 1647-1656` | `db.customStatement(...)` | timeseries DDL | `Database` table management | `not widget-reachable` — DDL run when a table is created or repaired, not from a control |
| `packages/tfc_dart/lib/core/alarm.dart:341` | `db.customInsert(r'''...''')` | alarm history | `AlarmMan` recording an alarm transition | `not widget-reachable` — driven by a PLC transition; the operator-facing ack path writes nothing here |
| `packages/tfc_mcp_server/lib/src/database/server_database.dart:376-389` | `customStatement(...)` | schema | migration callback | `not widget-reachable` — same as 2.1 |
| `lib/core/secure_storage/macos.dart:123, 152, 172`, `lib/core/secure_storage/other.dart:29`, `packages/tfc_dart/lib/core/secure_storage/linux.dart:52` | `_storage.delete(key:)` / `_legacy.delete(key:)` | OS keychain | the `MySecureStorage` implementations | `left open: secure storage is outside both guards` — see §3.4 |
| `lib/pages/ip_settings.dart:408, 1127` | `connection.delete()`, `connection.update(updatedSettings)` | NetworkManager | `/advanced/ip-settings` | `route-gated (Phase 2)` — `kRaisedRoutes` raises it to `administer` |
| `lib/pages/ip_settings.dart:588` | `_tracker.update(...)` | — | in-memory traffic-rate tracker | `not widget-reachable` — not a store; a false positive of a deliberately broad grep, recorded rather than filtered away |
| `packages/centroidx_upgrader/lib/src/manager_launcher.dart:170` | `staged.delete()` | filesystem | cleanup of a failed staging write; see 2.7 | `left open: the update path is ungated` — see §3.5 |
| `packages/tfc_dart/lib/core/state_man.dart:2175` | `wrapper.client.delete()` | — | OPC UA client teardown | `not widget-reachable` — not a store; disposes a connection |

**Nothing further found** in this section beyond `server_config_db.dart`, the
three MCP index classes and the audit stores: every other hit is either the
store's own implementation, a migration, or a `.delete(`/`.update(` on
something that is not a database at all.

### 2.3 `AppDatabase` handles and the `.db` accessor (script §3 — 60 hits at the 2026-08-29 run, 55 at the 2026-08-30 re-run, plus 176 collapsed in `database_drift.g.dart` at both)

This section exists to catch a *new accessor spelling* the first time it
appears. It found no handle that is not already covered by 2.1 or 2.2. Rows
here are therefore grouped by what the handle is used for.

| File and line | Call | Store | Reached from | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `lib/pages/history_view.dart:72, 1107, 1253, 1303` | `final adb = dbWrap.db` | `AppDatabase` | the history view | `guarded by 03-10` — the handle the five writes of 2.1 use |
| `lib/pages/history_view.dart:119, 138, 1217-1218` | `dbWrap.db.listHistoryViewPeriods/getHistoryViewKeys/getHistoryViewGraphs/getGlobalRetentionHorizon` | reads | the history view | `left open: read permissions are deferred` — spec §11 |
| `lib/providers/database.dart:17-29` | `AppDatabase.spawn(config)`, `db.db.open()/close()` | connection lifecycle | `databaseProvider` | `not widget-reachable` — opens and closes the connection; writes nothing |
| `lib/providers/access.dart:71, 104` | `AccessRepository(db.db)`, `DriftAuditSink(db.db)` | handles | `accessRepositoryProvider`, `auditSinkProvider` | `correct as-is` — the audit sink is the one direct Drift write that is correct by design |
| `lib/providers/mcp_bridge.dart:210`, `lib/providers/chat.dart:998, 1182`, `lib/providers/server_database.dart:13` | `dbWrapper.db` as `McpDatabase` | handle | MCP bridge and chat | `left open: reached over MCP, not from a widget` — see §3.2 |
| `lib/pages/server_config.dart:3209, 3224, 3258` | `ServerConfigDb.fetch(db.db)` / `publish(db.db, ...)` | `flutter_preferences` | `/advanced/server-config` | `guarded by 03-08` — and `route-gated (Phase 2)` besides |
| `lib/page_creator/assets/graph.dart:823-824`, `lib/providers/timeseries.dart:205, 208` | `db.db.enableNotificationChannel(...)`, `listenToChannel(...)` | LISTEN/NOTIFY | graph assets, the shared timeseries stream | `not widget-reachable` as a write — `enableNotificationChannel` issues DDL for a notify channel, not a data write; noted here rather than left silent |
| `lib/widgets/panes/database_stats_pane.dart:74, 86` | `db.db.config`, `db.db.customSelect(...)` | reads | the database stats pane | `left open: read permissions are deferred` |
| `packages/tfc_dart/lib/core/preferences.dart:250, 465, 556`, `packages/tfc_dart/lib/core/preferences_watch.dart:59, 75, 77`, `packages/tfc_dart/lib/core/alarm.dart:338, 362`, `packages/tfc_dart/lib/core/database.dart:512-580`, `packages/tfc_dart/lib/core/access/access_repository.dart:98-100`, `packages/tfc_dart/lib/core/access/drift_audit_sink.dart:53` | `final db = ...!.db`, `AppDatabase db` fields | handles | core machinery | `correct as-is` — the stores holding their own handle |
| `lib/core/guarded_history_views.dart:85, 98` | `required AppDatabase db`, `final AppDatabase _db` | `AppDatabase` | `historyViewStoreProvider` | `correct as-is` — the handle 2.1's guard delegates through; the check happens above it |
| `lib/core/access_template_store.dart:163, 176` | `required AppDatabase db`, `final AppDatabase _db` | `AppDatabase` | `AccessTemplateStore` | `correct as-is` — the handle 2.2's guard delegates through; the check happens above it. Same `_db` spelling as `HistoryViewStore`, so no ninth accessor |
| `lib/core/audit_trail_store.dart:413, 417` | `required AppDatabase db`, `final AppDatabase _db` | `AppDatabase` | `AuditTrailStore` | `correct as-is` — the handle Phase 5's **read-only** trail viewer holds. It is on this table because it names `AppDatabase`, not because it writes: the file contains no `into(`, no `update(` and no `delete(`, and `test/core/audit_trail_store_test.dart` asserts that on the source text rather than leaving it merely true today. The enforcement is the route gate `kRaisedRoutes['/advanced/audit-trail']` (05-07) and deliberately not a store check — a guard here would write a row into the trail every time somebody scrolled the trail, on the same reasoning `access_template_store.dart` gives for its own ungated reads. Same `_db` spelling as `HistoryViewStore` and `AccessTemplateStore`, so no ninth accessor |
| `lib/providers/access_templates.dart:109` | `db: db.db` | `AppDatabase` | `accessTemplateStoreProvider` | `correct as-is` — the provider that hands `AccessTemplateStore` its handle, one line, no statement of its own. Same `db.db` spelling `accessRepositoryProvider` and `auditSinkProvider` already use, so no ninth accessor |
| `lib/providers/audit_trail.dart:53` | `db: db.db` | `AppDatabase` | `auditTrailStoreProvider` | `correct as-is` — the provider that hands the **read-only** `AuditTrailStore` its handle, one line, no statement of its own. It is on this table because it names the `.db` accessor, not because it writes: the file contains no Drift statement at all, and `test/providers/audit_trail_test.dart` asserts on the source text that it holds no audit sink and performs no permission check. The enforcement is the route gate `kRaisedRoutes['/advanced/audit-trail']` (05-07), on the same reasoning `lib/core/audit_trail_store.dart` gives above. Same `db.db` spelling `accessRepositoryProvider`, `auditSinkProvider` and `accessTemplateStoreProvider` already use, so no ninth accessor |
| `packages/tfc_dart/lib/core/database_drift.g.dart` (176 occurrences) | generated `_$AppDatabase` boilerplate | — | drift codegen | `not widget-reachable` — regenerated from `database_drift.dart`, which is searched above; collapsed by the script and counted |

**Seven accessor spellings at the 2026-08-29 run — `adb`, `dbWrap.db`,
`db.db`, `dbWrapper.db`, `_tsDb!.db`, `database!.db` and
`preferences.database!.db` — and an eighth at the 2026-08-30 re-run:
`HistoryViewStore._db` (`lib/core/guarded_history_views.dart:98`).** All eight
are covered above. The eighth is a guard this phase added rather than a store
this phase missed, which is the distinction this section exists to make
visible: a new spelling is reported either way, and the reader decides which
kind it is.

### 2.4 `SharedPreferencesAsync()` constructed rather than injected (script §4 — 12 hits at the 2026-08-29 run, **1** at the 2026-08-30 re-run)

Spec §6 names **one** of these. There were twelve, in eight files, and nine of
the twelve were outside `lib/providers/` — the directory the spec's own CI check
would allow.

**Now enforced.** Plan 03-11 added
`scripts/check-preferences-construction.sh`, wired into the `flutter-test` job
of `.github/workflows/test.yml`, which fails the build for any construction
under `lib/` or `centroid-hmi/lib/` outside `lib/providers/`. The check found
**nine** violations against the tree this table describes and finds **zero**
now. The hit counts in the headings above are the pre-phase ones; plan 03-12
re-runs the sweep and reconciles them.

| File and line | Call | Store | Reached from | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `lib/providers/preferences.dart:26` | `createDeviceLocalPreferences()` — `SharedPreferencesWrapper(SharedPreferencesAsync())` | device-local | the two preference providers, and every site below that has no `ref` | `correct as-is` — this is the one place that is meant to construct it, and after 03-11 it is the only one |
| `lib/providers/collector.dart:21` | `final prefs = SharedPreferencesAsync()` | device-local | `collectorProvider`, at boot | `enforced by 03-09` — spec §6 bypass 2; gone from the tree, and the check would refuse its return |
| `lib/core/update_channel.dart:29, 41` | `prefs ?? createDeviceLocalPreferences()` | device-local | `readUpdateChannel` / `writeUpdateChannel`, called as tear-offs from `centroid-hmi/lib/main.dart:337, 372` and `lib/widgets/preferences.dart:79-80` | `enforced by 03-11` — the parameter is a `PreferencesApi` now, so the tear-off form is unchanged |
| `lib/tech_docs/tech_doc_library_section.dart:1197` | field on `_SharedPrefsReader`, from the factory | device-local | the Knowledge Base page's delete-document flow | `enforced by 03-11` |
| `lib/pages/page_view.dart:259` | `late final PreferencesApi prefs = ref.read(localPreferencesProvider)` | device-local | every asset page, on mount | `enforced by 03-11` — a `ref` exists, so it reads the provider rather than the factory |
| `lib/widgets/preferences.dart:556` | field on `_DatabaseConfigEditorState` | device-local | nothing — `grep -n sharedPreferences lib/widgets/preferences.dart` returned this line and no other | `enforced by 03-11` — **deleted**, not rerouted; confirmed unreferenced first |
| `lib/widgets/preferences.dart:822` | `ref.read(localPreferencesProvider)` in `_loadData` | device-local | the preferences page, read path (`localPrefs.getAll()`) | `route-gated (Phase 2)` — `/advanced/preferences` is `administer`; the construction is `enforced by 03-11` |
| `lib/widgets/panes/color_picker_dialog.dart:46, 70` | the factory, inline in two statics | device-local | any colour picker, anywhere in the app | `enforced by 03-11` — both statics keep their `try`/`catch`, so a broken store is still an empty strip |
| `centroid-hmi/lib/main.dart:273` | `createDeviceLocalPreferences()` | device-local | app boot, feeding `PageManager(prefs:)` and `pageManager.load()` on the next two lines | `enforced by 03-11` — this is the boot write of `page_editor_data` outside any provider; no `ProviderScope` exists yet, so it calls the factory |

### 2.5 Legacy synchronous `SharedPreferences.getInstance()` (script §5 — 6 hits)

Spec §6 does not mention this API, and the CI check it asks for
(`SharedPreferencesAsync()`) would never catch it. It is in the tree today.

**Now enforced, on a wider rule than the spec wrote.**
`scripts/check-preferences-construction.sh` searches for this pattern as well
as the one §6 names, under the same rule: anything outside `lib/providers/`
fails the build. Both files below are still in the tree and both are still
open — the point is that the check *looks* at them and lets them past for a
stated reason rather than never looking. The six hits are zero violations, and
that arithmetic is the whole content of the two rows.

| File and line | Call | Store | Reached from | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|

These are **not bypasses**. They are the surface plan 03-01 classifies, and the
reason they are enumerated is that neither a construction search nor a Drift
search produces a single hit for them. Every key expression below is resolved

they get rows so that they are visible rather than implied.

---

## 3. What is left open, and why

Each entry says what closing it would take, so a later phase can price it.

### 3.1 Three raw-Drift index classes reachable from the Knowledge Base page

**What.** `DriftTechDocIndex`, `DriftPlcCodeIndex` and `DriftDrawingIndex` live
in `packages/tfc_mcp_server/lib/src/services/`, and each writes Drift directly —
twenty-six `into(...)` / `delete(...)` / `update(...)` statements between them
(twelve, eight and six respectively). They were built for the MCP server, but all three are wired into the
Flutter app through providers (`lib/providers/tech_doc.dart`,
`lib/providers/plc.dart:65`, `lib/providers/drawing.dart:14`) and their write
methods are called from app code:

- `lib/tech_docs/tech_doc_upload_service.dart:104, 149, 221-222, 275` —
  `storeDocument`, `updateSections`, `updatePdfBytes`, `deleteDocument`.
- `lib/tech_docs/tech_doc_library_section.dart:1075, 1133` — `reindexAsset` and
  `deleteAssetIndex` on `DriftPlcCodeIndex`, called straight from the page.
- `lib/drawings/drawing_upload_service.dart:46, 61, 75` — `storeDrawing` and
  `deleteDrawing`. `DrawingUploadDialog` has no caller in the tree today, so
  this third one is reachable in principle and unwired in fact.

**Where the operator was, when this was written.** `/advanced/knowledge-base`
was deliberately **not** in `kRaisedRoutes`, and `lib/access_routes.dart` named
it among the pages that "read rather than configure". It does not only read: an
anonymous session at the panel could delete a technical document, delete a PLC
asset's index, and — through `tech_doc_upload_service.dart:267` — rewrite
`page_editor_data`. That is the claim plan 03-14 acted on; the route is raised
now and both spellings of the sentence are gone from the source.

**Why this is the same defect as the history view.** A destructive control on a
page that should stay readable. §6's fourth bypass was exactly that, on
`/advanced/history-view`, and plan 03-10 fixes it at the controls rather than at
the route for exactly this reason.

**Closed, at both ends.** This document found it and owned no fix; two plans
were then written for it and both have landed.

- **The controls, by plan 03-13.** One guarded store object per index, holding
  the write methods, checking `configure` on the destructive ones and auditing
  all of them, with the app-side call sites changing only their receiver
  (`lib/core/guarded_knowledge_stores.dart`, wired at
  `lib/providers/tech_doc.dart`, `lib/providers/plc.dart` and
  `lib/providers/drawing.dart`). The index classes themselves are unchanged.
- **The route, by plan 03-14.** `/advanced/knowledge-base` is the seventh entry
  in `kRaisedRoutes` at `AccessGroup.configure`, and its child in
  `centroid-hmi/lib/main.dart` is wrapped in the same `gated(...)` helper the
  other six use. An anonymous session now sees the locked page, and the menu
  entry stays visible with a lock badge rather than disappearing.

**Why both, rather than either.** The route gate alone would leave the three
write surfaces unaudited for anybody who does hold `configure` — the same group
`page_editor_data` is worth. The control guards alone would leave a page that
reaches three write surfaces open to a session holding nothing.

**The accepted cost, stated plainly.** An anonymous operator can no longer read
technical documents or browse PLC code at the panel. On a plant floor that is a
real loss: somebody wanting a manual at the machine now has to find a person
with a `configure` account, or walk. The user was told and chose it over leaving
a write path around the page-editor gate. It is the one place in this milestone
where gating a route takes something away from an operator rather than only from
a configurer, and spec §11's deferral of read permissions is not a defence here
— this page writes.

**What is not lost**, stated as precisely. The drawings overlay on ordinary
pages (`centroid-hmi/lib/main.dart:763-781`) is a different surface — not this
route, read-only, and 03-13's decorators pass reads straight through — so a
drawing is still available on the page an operator is standing at.

**The evidence above is kept deliberately.** The file-and-line list and the
`page_editor_data` argument are what make this finding re-checkable; a closed
finding with its evidence deleted is a finding nobody can audit.

### 3.2 Writes reached over MCP rather than from a widget

**What.** `TfcMcpServer` runs **inside the HMI process**
(`lib/mcp/mcp_bridge_notifier.dart:266`, `lib/mcp/mcp_sse_server.dart:56`), so
its tool handlers reach the same stores the app does:
`read_toggles.dart:38, 114` writes `mcp.config`, and
`audit_log_service.dart:47, 85` writes the MCP audit table.

**Why it was deferred.** No widget reaches them; the caller is a remote agent
over SSE. Spec §7c already decided what happens: MCP tools that change
authorization are gated on `users` and audited with `origin = 'mcp'` and `who` =
the approving human. That was Phase 4's work, not Phase 3's.

**Closed by Phase 4, plan 04-09 — the authorization half.** The deferral is
discharged and this is what discharged it, so that a reader can check the claim
rather than take it:

- Six tools in `packages/tfc_mcp_server/lib/src/tools/access_template_tools.dart`
  (spec §7c's names): `list_access_templates` and `list_unbound_keys` read;
  `create_access_template`, `update_access_template`,
  `delete_access_template` and `bind_key_access_template` change nothing at
  all and return a **proposal**.
- **Nothing in `tfc_mcp_server` writes** either authorization table.
  `AccessTemplateService` has no write method, public or private, and a test
  greps both files for write verbs. That property is what the rest of this
  entry rests on.
- **The `users` gate is at the approval, not in the tool.** The MCP server is
  a separate package with no session — it cannot know who is standing at the
  panel, and shipping an `AccessSession` into it would be exactly the
  `tfc_dart` dependency `packages/tfc_access`'s purity rule exists to avoid.
  So an accepted proposal is applied in the app, by
  `lib/pages/access_templates_section.dart`, through 04-03's
  `AccessTemplateStore` — the same `users`-gated store the section's own
  buttons use, and the only writer of `access_template` and
  `access_key_binding`. An agent proposing a change nobody may make gets a
  proposal nobody can approve, and an `allowed: false` row saying so.
- **`origin = 'mcp'` on every applied row, and `who` = the approving human.**
  `origin` is the only thing the accept path tells the store about
  provenance; `who` comes from the live session at the moment of the write,
  and there is no parameter through which a proposal could name somebody
  else. `test/pages/access_template_proposal_test.dart` seeds a proposal with
  a conflicting `operator_id` and asserts the row carries the signed-in user.

**What stays open, and stays rowed.** The closure above is about MCP writes
that change **authorization**. It is not about the two write sites this entry
enumerates, which are still reached over MCP and still ungated:
`read_toggles.dart:38, 114` writes `mcp.config`, and
`audit_log_service.dart:47, 85` writes the MCP audit table. Neither is
authorization data — one is the copilot's own tool configuration, the other
the copilot's own trail — and neither was in §7c's scope. Their rows in §2
therefore still read `left open: reached over MCP, not from a widget`, and
that is deliberate: a section that closed *by* emptying its evidence is the
defect this document exists to prevent, and a verdict that quietly widened
from "the authorization half" to "all of it" would be the same defect wearing
a better mood.

### 3.3 The access repository writes its own store

`packages/tfc_dart/lib/core/access/access_repository.dart` writes `app_role` and
`app_user` through raw Drift — twelve `into(...)` / `update(...)` / `delete(...)`
statements. It is the authorization store itself; a guard consulting the policy
to decide whether the policy's own data may change would be circular. Spec §7c
and §9 put roles and users behind `AccessGroup.users`, and Phase 6 builds the
screens that drive it. Closing it means gating those screens, not decorating
this class.

**Closed by Phase 6, plan 06-03.** The condition written above is the one that
was met, so here is what met it, in a form a reader can check rather than take:

- `AccessAdminStore` (`lib/core/access_admin_store.dart`) is the one object the
  screens write through. It names its permission once, as `kAccessAdminGroup =
  AccessGroup.users` — the same shape `access_template_store.dart` uses for
  `kAccessTemplateGroup`.
- **All eight writes ask that gate**: `createRole`, `updateRole`, `deleteRole`,
  `renameRole`, `createUser`, `deleteUser`, `setUserRole` and `setUserPassword`.
  There is no ninth, and there is no generic row builder — each write is paired
  with one of 06-01's eight named `AuditRecord` constructors, which is what fixes
  the itemKey vocabulary in one place.
- **Every one of them records a row, refusals included.** The deny row is written
  *before* the `AccessDenied` is thrown, because a refusal that leaves no trace
  is the one kind of guard nobody can audit afterwards.
  `test/core/access_admin_store_test.dart` drives a `configure`-only session —
  the page editor who must not be able to grant themselves `users` — into all
  eight, so the gate is checked rather than remembered.

**What closing it did not mean, stated because the entry said so in advance.**
The repository was *not* decorated. It still writes both tables through Drift,
correctly, because it is the layer that owns `db.transaction` and the
last-`users`-holder invariant that has to be evaluated inside it. A decorator
here would have had to reach an `AccessSession` from `packages/tfc_dart`, which
is the dependency `packages/tfc_access`'s purity rule exists to avoid, and it
would have put the invariant outside the transaction that makes it an invariant.

**What the closure does not claim.** `AccessRepository` remains constructible
and callable directly by anything holding an `AppDatabase`; nothing about the
class refuses. **The gate is a property of the path the UI takes, not of the
class**, and the honest form of that claim is a test rather than a sentence: no
file under `lib/pages/` constructs an `AccessRepository`, asserted in
`test/core/phase_03_coverage_test.dart`. The page layer reaches the repository
only through `accessAdminStoreProvider`, and the store is the thing that asks.

One caller is a deliberate exception and is named here so the paragraph above is
not read as more than it is: `lib/pages/first_user.dart:141` calls
`repo.createFirstUser(...)` straight off `accessRepositoryProvider`. That is the
first-user window, which exists precisely for the state in which nobody can hold
`users` yet — `app_user` is empty — and it is checked *inside* the transaction
rather than by a guard. It writes no other row and cannot run once an account
exists.

**The line span was dropped from this entry deliberately.** It read `:177-340`
when the entry was written and every one of those numbers moved when 06-02 added
the five user methods. This document's own reconciliation test matches by file
and never by line for that reason, so a count of statements is the claim that
survives a reformat. The §2 row above still lists today's lines, because that is
the table's shape and because `scripts/sweep-write-paths.sh` reprints them on
demand — but the argument this entry makes does not rest on them.

### 3.4 Secure storage is outside both guards

`MySecureStorage` (`packages/tfc_dart/lib/core/secure_storage/interface.dart:1`)
is reached through a process-wide singleton, `SecureStorage.getInstance()`, and
neither `GuardedStateMan` nor `GuardedPreferences` wraps it. Three things live
there: `state_man_config`, the database config
(`packages/tfc_dart/lib/core/database.dart:214-226`) and the D-Bus password.

The first two are already covered in practice — `state_man_config` is written
through `Preferences.setString(..., secret: true)`, which the guard *does* wrap
(`packages/tfc_dart/lib/core/preferences.dart:205` is below the decorator), and
the database config is written only from two `administer`-gated routes. The
third is §3.7.

**What closing it would take.** A third decorator over `MySecureStorage`, or
replacing the singleton with an injected instance so the existing decorator can
reach it. The singleton is the obstacle: `SecureStorage.getInstance()` has
callers that hold no `Preferences` at all.

### 3.5 The update path writes and launches a binary, ungated

`packages/centroidx_upgrader/lib/src/manager_launcher.dart:159` writes the
centroidx-manager binary to disk and `:160` renames it into place; the caller is
`managerLauncher.launchForUpdate(...)` at `centroid-hmi/lib/main.dart:369`,
driven by the app's update affordance. No route gates it and no guard sees it.

This is the highest-consequence write in the sweep and the least like the
others: it is not configuration, it is code. It is recorded here rather than
fixed because the update flow is outside this milestone's scope entirely — the
spec does not mention it, and gating it is a product decision about who may
update a station, not an access-control mechanism question.

**What closing it would take.** Either an `administer` check at the update
affordance in `centroid-hmi/lib/main.dart`, or accepting it explicitly on the
grounds that the binary is signature-checked upstream. Somebody should decide
which; today neither has been decided, which is why this entry exists.

### 3.6 `lib/providers/theme.dart` — device-local UI state on the legacy API

Four `SharedPreferences.getInstance()` calls writing `theme_mode` and
`color_scheme`. Plan 03-01 classifies both as `operate`: they are what a panel
writes about itself, not plant configuration. The file is inside
`lib/providers/`, so spec §6's CI grep does not apply to it even once plan 03-11
extends that grep to the legacy API.

**What closing it would take.** Routing both notifiers through
`localPreferencesProvider` so the writes pass the guard and appear in the audit
trail. It is cheap; it is left open because the value is low — an `operate` key
an anonymous session may write anyway — and because moving it touches the theme
path, which every golden in the repository depends on.

### 3.7 `lib/pages/dbus_login.dart` — excluded by the spec

Two `SharedPreferences.getInstance()` calls writing five bare keys
(`connectionType`, `host`, `username`, `autoLogin`, `sshPrivateKeyPath`) and one
`secureStorage.write(key: 'dbus_password', ...)`.

Spec §2 excludes changing this file from the whole milestone, and says why: the
D-Bus credential is a **station** credential, the same kind of thing as the OPC
UA session and the Postgres login, and D-Bus is the mechanism *underneath*
`administer` rather than something `administer` governs. Plan 03-01 still
classifies all five keys as `administer`, so if the writes are ever routed
through the guard the classification is already there.

**What closing it would take.** Lifting the §2 exclusion, then the same
treatment as any other page. The exclusion is a decision, not an oversight.

### 3.8 `lib/widgets/tfc_operations.dart` — an unwired D-Bus operation-mode write

`callSetMode('running' | 'stopped' | 'cleaning')` at `:22`, `:24` and `:69`
changes the plant's operation mode over D-Bus from an app-bar button. It is
**not wired**: `OperationModeAppBarLeftWidgetProvider` is constructed nowhere,
and `globalAppBarLeftWidgetProvider` (`lib/widgets/base_scaffold.dart:36`)
defaults to null with no override anywhere in the tree.

Left open for two reasons. It writes nothing today. And if it were wired,
starting and stopping the line is an operator action by design — the first line
of `REQUIREMENTS.md`'s acceptance criteria is that an unauthenticated session
can jog, start and stop.

**What closing it would take.** Nothing, unless it is wired. If somebody wires
it, the cleaning-mode call is the one worth a second look — cleaning is a mode
change with process consequences, not a start/stop.

### 3.9 `GuardedPreferences.systemWrites`

Plan 03-05 gives `GuardedPreferences` a `systemWrites` getter returning a
`Preferences` whose write members skip the session check. It exists because five
writes fire at boot with nobody signed in, on keys that are not `operate`:

| Write | Key | Group | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lib/page_creator/page.dart:247` (unawaited, from `PageManager.load()`) | `page_editor_data` | `configure` | 03-06 |
| `lib/providers/state_man.dart:26` (`fetchKeyMappings`) | `key_mappings` | `configure` | 03-06 |
| `packages/tfc_dart/lib/core/state_man.dart:442` (`StateManConfig.fromPrefs`) | `state_man_config` | `administer` | 03-06 |
| `packages/tfc_dart/lib/core/alarm.dart:220` (`AlarmMan.create`) | `alarm_man_config` | `configure` | 03-06 |
| `lib/providers/collector.dart:27` (`collectorProvider`) | `collector_config` | `administer` | 03-09 |

Without `systemWrites` each of these is denied on a fresh station and the
station is broken in a way no screen shows — the page editor case takes the
pages away entirely.

**The residual risk.** It is a bypass by construction. Anything holding a
`GuardedPreferences` can reach it. The controls are that it is a distinct object
rather than a `system: true` flag (a flag is one keystroke from an operator
path), that every `systemWrites` write still produces exactly one audit row with
`origin: 'system'` and the group that *would* have been required, and that plan
03-06 caps the call sites: `kSystemWriteCallSites` in
`lib/providers/access_policy.dart` names every file allowed to use it, and a
test compares the grep result to that list in both directions.

**What closing it would take.** Removing the need for it — making the five boot
defaults lazy, or writing them under an explicit commissioning identity rather
than an anonymous session. Both are larger than this phase.

### 3.10 `GuardedPreferences.database`

`GuardedPreferences implements Preferences`, and `Preferences` declares a
`database` getter. The decorator must therefore supply one, so anything holding
the guarded object can write `guardedPrefs.database.db` and issue raw Drift —
past the guard it is holding.

**The control, stated exactly.** Section 3 of `scripts/sweep-write-paths.sh`
searches the `AppDatabase` type and the `.db` accessor, so such a call appears
in the sweep the first time it is written, and plan 03-12 fails when a hit has
no row here. That is a *detection* control, not a prevention: it finds the call
after it exists, on the next run.

**Why it is not preventable cheaply.** Dropping `implements Preferences` means
every caller changes, which is the whole reason the decorator idiom was chosen.
Returning null from the getter breaks the callers that legitimately need the
database handle (`preferences.database!.db` at
`packages/tfc_dart/lib/core/alarm.dart:338, 362`, among others).

**What closing it would take.** Splitting `Preferences` so that the database
handle lives on a narrower interface the decorator does not have to expose. That
is a refactor of `tfc_dart`'s core, not a guard change.

---

## 4. Is there a fifth?

**Yes.** Spec §6's four are each owned by a plan in this phase. Beyond them the
sweep found five further things, listed here by name with who owns each.

### 4.1 New, and owned by no plan in this phase

**A. Three raw-Drift index classes reachable from the ungated Knowledge Base
page.** `DriftTechDocIndex`, `DriftPlcCodeIndex` and `DriftDrawingIndex` in
`packages/tfc_mcp_server/lib/src/services/`, called from
`lib/tech_docs/tech_doc_upload_service.dart:104, 149, 221-222, 275`,
`lib/tech_docs/tech_doc_library_section.dart:1075, 1133` and
`lib/drawings/drawing_upload_service.dart:46, 61, 75`. An anonymous session on
`/advanced/knowledge-base` can delete a technical document, delete a PLC asset's
index and rewrite `page_editor_data`. **This is the fifth bypass, and it is the
same shape as the fourth**: a destructive control on a page classified as a read
surface. Owners: **plan 03-13** (the controls, through guarded store objects)
and **plan 03-14** (the route, raised to `configure` as the seventh entry in
`kRaisedRoutes`). **Closed** — see §3.1, which keeps the evidence and records
the accepted cost.

**B. An ungated write-and-launch of the manager binary.**
`packages/centroidx_upgrader/lib/src/manager_launcher.dart:159`, reached from
`centroid-hmi/lib/main.dart:369`. Owner: none. Priced in §3.5.

**C. An unwired D-Bus operation-mode write.**
`lib/widgets/tfc_operations.dart:22, 24, 69`. Writes nothing today because
nothing constructs its provider. Owner: none. Priced in §3.8.

**F. A NetworkManager write helper the first run did not have a row for.**
`lib/core/network_manager_ops.dart:86` (`client.settings.addConnection`) and
`:107` (`client.activateConnection`). Found by plan 03-12's re-run, comparing
the script's hits against this document's rows **by file** in both directions —
the first mechanical reconciliation this document has had.

**It is not a sixth bypass class.** The file's only importer anywhere in the
tree is `lib/pages/ip_settings.dart:10`, so every one of these calls is reached
from `/advanced/ip-settings`, which `kRaisedRoutes` raises to `administer`. The
verdict is `route-gated (Phase 2)`, identical to the `ip_settings.dart` rows in
§2.8 that this document already carried.

**It is still a finding, and the useful kind.** The file was committed on
2026-08-27 (`ae4c60fa`, the ip-settings bond fix) — *before* the 2026-08-29
sweep, not after it. So the first run's grep found these lines and the human
writing §2.8 did not give them a row: the section listed the page and missed
the helper the page calls. That is the §6-fourth-bypass failure in miniature,
and it says something about this document rather than about the tree: **a
verdict list assembled by reading is a list with holes in it, and only the
mechanical both-directions comparison finds them.** `test/core/phase_03_coverage_test.dart`
is that comparison, and it now fails on the next such omission instead of
waiting for somebody to notice.

### 4.2 Beyond §6's list, but already owned

**D. Nine further `SharedPreferencesAsync()` constructions outside
`lib/providers/`.** Spec §6 names `lib/providers/collector.dart:21`. The script
finds twelve constructions in eight files; three are inside `lib/providers/`
(two of them the sanctioned ones in `preferences.dart`), and the other nine are:
`lib/core/update_channel.dart:23, 35`,
`lib/tech_docs/tech_doc_library_section.dart:1194`, `lib/pages/page_view.dart:253`,
`lib/widgets/preferences.dart:556, 825`,
`lib/widgets/panes/color_picker_dialog.dart:42, 66` and
`centroid-hmi/lib/main.dart:269`. Owner: plan 03-11, whose own table already
names each. `lib/widgets/preferences.dart:556` is a dead field with no other
reference in the file.

**Closed and enforced.** All nine are gone. Eight were rerouted to
`createDeviceLocalPreferences()` or `localPreferencesProvider`; the dead field
was deleted. `scripts/check-preferences-construction.sh` found these nine and
now finds none, and the `flutter-test` job fails on a tenth.

**E. Six legacy `SharedPreferences.getInstance()` calls.** An API spec §6 does
not mention and its proposed CI check would not catch:
`lib/providers/theme.dart:15, 22, 44, 51` and `lib/pages/dbus_login.dart:124, 141`.
Owner: plan 03-11, which extends the check to the legacy API. Both files stay
open on purpose — §3.6 and §3.7.

**Enforced.** The check searches for this pattern under the same
outside-`lib/providers/` rule. `theme.dart` passes on the directory rule;
`dbus_login.dart` is the check's single allow-list entry, carrying §2's
exclusion as its reason. A seventh call anywhere else fails the build.

### 4.3 Where the answer was "nothing further"

Recorded so a later phase does not repeat the search or, worse, assume it:

- **The raw Drift statement API (script §2, 116 hits).** Beyond
  `lib/core/server_config_db.dart` and the three index classes of finding A,
  **nothing further found**. Every other hit is the store's own implementation,
  a drift `Migrator` callback, the audit sink, the access repository, or a
  `.delete(` / `.update(` on something that is not a database.
- **`AppDatabase` handles (script §3, 60 hits).** Seven accessor spellings exist
  in the tree — `adb`, `dbWrap.db`, `db.db`, `dbWrapper.db`, `_tsDb!.db`,
  `database!.db`, `preferences.database!.db` — and every one is accounted for in
  2.3. **Nothing further found**: no eighth spelling, and no handle that leads to
  a write not already listed.
- **File writes (script §7, 3 hits).** Three in the entire tree, all three in
  2.7. **Nothing further found.**
- **The preference key inventory (script §9).** Every key expression resolves to
  a rule in `kPrefAccessRules`; **no key the app writes rests on the
  `administer` default.** See §5.

### 4.3a What the 2026-08-30 re-run found

Recorded as a result rather than as a reassurance, because an unrecorded
negative gets assumed next time rather than trusted.

The re-run's hits were reconciled against this document's table rows by file,
in both directions. Seven files carried hits with no row:

| File | Hits | What it turned out to be |
|---|---|---|
| `lib/core/guarded_history_views.dart` | 12 | plan 03-10's guard — new, and the shape a closed bypass has |
| `packages/tfc_dart/lib/core/access/guarded_preferences.dart` | 12 | plan 03-05's guard — new; its two holes were already priced in §2.10 without a file and line, and now have one |
| `lib/core/network_manager_ops.dart` | 7 | **the one genuine finding — §4.1 F.** Pre-dated the first run and had no row |
| `packages/tfc_dart/lib/core/preferences_watch.dart` | 3 | already covered in 2.3, but named by bare filename; now a full path |
| `packages/tfc_dart/lib/core/secure_storage/interface.dart` | 1 | same — 2.6 named it by bare filename |
| `lib/providers/alarm.dart` | 1 | plan 03-06's seventh system-write site — new |
| `lib/core/guarded_knowledge_stores.dart` | 1 | plan 03-13's guard — new |

In the reverse direction **one** row had no hit —
`packages/tfc_dart/lib/core/database_drift.g.dart`, which the script collapses
to a counted `[generated]` line by design and therefore never emits as a
`file:line` hit. No row was stale.

**Beyond finding F, nothing further found.** No new write surface, no new
accessor spelling that is not a guard this phase added, and no site whose
verdict this document cannot state.

### 4.4 What §5 checked and did not find

The rule this document is meant to enforce — *a key the app writes in normal
operation may not rest on the `administer` default* — is satisfied. Every one of
the thirty-odd key expressions in §5 is matched by an explicit rule. There is no
finding of that shape to raise here.

There is a related risk that is **not** a rule violation and is named anyway,
because it is the same failure with a different cause: five keys are written at
boot by an anonymous session on groups that session does not hold
(`page_editor_data`, `key_mappings`, `state_man_config`, `alarm_man_config`,
`collector_config`). Under a fail-closed guard with no escape hatch, every one
of them is denied on a fresh station. Plan 03-05's `systemWrites` and plan
03-06's wiring exist for exactly these five, and 03-09 covers the last. §3.9
lists them with their owners.

---

## 5. Config keys, reconciled

One row per key expression from script section 9, against `kPrefAccessRules` in
`packages/tfc_access/lib/src/access_policy.dart`. **Plan 03-01 landed while this
sweep ran**, so this reconciles against the code rather than against plan text.
Plan 03-12 checks the reconciliation again.

The **when** column is the point of the table. A write that fires before anybody
can sign in, or merely because an operator opened a page, is a different risk
from one behind a Save button.

| Call site | Expression as written | Resolves to | Rule in `kPrefAccessRules` | Group | When |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `startup_url.dart:24, 26` | `startupUrlPrefsKey` | `startup_url` | exact `startup_url` | `operate` | behind a control |
| `update_channel.dart:36` | `updateChannelPrefsKey` | `update_channel` | exact `update_channel` | `administer` | behind a control |
| `chat_widget.dart:189` | `kSelectedProvider` | `llm.selected_provider` | prefix `llm.` | `administer` | behind a control |
| `chat_widget.dart:361` | `prefKey` (switch on provider) | `llm.claude.api_key`, `llm.openai.api_key`, `llm.gemini.api_key` | prefix `llm.` | `administer` | behind a control |
| `chat_widget.dart:392, 394` | `urlPrefKey` (ternary) | `llm.claude.base_url`, `llm.openai.base_url` | prefix `llm.` | `administer` | behind a control |
| `providers/state_man.dart:26` | `'key_mappings'` | `key_mappings` | exact `key_mappings` | `configure` | **boot-time** — `fetchKeyMappings` writes a default when absent |
| `providers/collector.dart:27` | `Collector.configLocation` | `collector_config` | exact `collector_config` | `administer` | **boot-time** — default written when absent |
| `providers/access.dart:694` | `kAccessSessionPrefKey` | `access.session` | exact `access.session` | `operate` | **read-path** — every `poke()`, i.e. every pointer-down |
| `providers/chat.dart:340, 370, 405, 449, 525, 905` | `'$kConversationPrefix$id'` | `chat.conversation.<id>` | prefix `chat.` | `operate` | behind a control |
| `providers/chat.dart:529, 548` | `kConversationList` | `chat.conversations` | prefix `chat.` | `operate` | behind a control |
| `providers/chat.dart:532, 558` | `kActiveConversation` | `chat.active_conversation` | prefix `chat.` | `operate` | behind a control |
| `providers/chat.dart:453, 494, 505, 535, 538` | `kChatHistory` | `chat.history` | prefix `chat.` | `operate` | behind a control, plus a one-time migration |
| `providers/theme.dart:23` | `_key` (`ThemeModeNotifier`) | `theme_mode` | exact `theme_mode` | `operate` | behind a control — **legacy API; never reaches the guard**, §3.6 |
| `providers/theme.dart:52` | `_key` (`ColorSchemeNotifier`) | `color_scheme` | exact `color_scheme` | `operate` | behind a control — same |
| `tech_doc_upload_service.dart:267` | `'page_editor_data'` | `page_editor_data` | exact `page_editor_data` | `configure` | **delete-path** — rewritten when a tech doc is deleted, from an ungated route (§3.1) |
| `tech_doc_library_section.dart:1203` | `key` (a `PrefsReader` parameter) | `page_editor_data` — the adapter's only caller is the row above | exact `page_editor_data` | `configure` | same |
| `key_repository.dart:637, 1933` | `'key_mappings'` | `key_mappings` | exact `key_mappings` | `configure` | behind a control, on a `configure`-gated route |
| `page_view.dart:264` | `'asset_stack_config'` | `asset_stack_config` | exact `asset_stack_config` | `operate` | **read-path** — written when the key is absent, on mount of any asset page |
| `dbus_login.dart:127-131` | five literals | `connectionType`, `host`, `username`, `autoLogin`, `sshPrivateKeyPath` | five exact rules | `administer` | behind a control — **legacy API**, §3.7 |
| `page_creator/page.dart:247` | `storageKey` | `page_editor_data` | exact `page_editor_data` | `configure` | **boot-time, unawaited** — a denial here surfaces as an unhandled async error and a default that never persists |
| `page_creator/page.dart:252` | `storageKey` | `page_editor_data` | exact | `configure` | behind a control |
| `page_creator/page.dart:257` | `orderStorageKey` | `page_editor_top_level_order` | exact `page_editor_top_level_order` | `configure` | behind a control |
| `image_store.dart:96, 129` | `'$keyPrefix$id'` | `page_editor_image:<id>` | prefix `page_editor_image:` | `configure` | behind a control |
| `page_creator/assets/common.dart:444` | `'key_mappings'` | `key_mappings` | exact | `configure` | behind a control |
| `recipes.dart:269` | `'${widget.config.recipesBucket}.recipes'` | `<bucket>.recipes` | suffix `.recipes` | `setpoints` | **read-path** — `_getRecipes` writes an empty default, so an anonymous operator merely opening a recipes asset triggers it |
| `recipes.dart:281` | same expression | `<bucket>.recipes` | suffix `.recipes` | `setpoints` | behind a control |
| `widgets/preferences.dart:949-957, 979, 981` | `e.key` | **cannot be resolved to a literal or a prefix** — the key is whatever row the operator is editing, so the group is whatever rule matches at runtime | every rule, at runtime | varies | behind a control, on the `administer`-gated `/advanced/preferences` |
| `color_picker_dialog.dart:66` | `prefsKey` | `color_picker_recent_colors` | exact `color_picker_recent_colors` | `operate` | behind a control (confirming a colour) |
| `tfc_dart/core/state_man.dart:442` | `configKey` | `state_man_config` | exact `state_man_config` | `administer` | **boot-time** — `StateManConfig.fromPrefs` writes a default when absent |
| `tfc_dart/core/state_man.dart:450` | `configKey` | `state_man_config` | exact | `administer` | behind a control |
| `tfc_dart/core/state_man.dart:626` | `'key_mappings'` | `key_mappings` | exact | `configure` | behind a control |
| `tfc_dart/core/alarm.dart:220` | `'alarm_man_config'` | `alarm_man_config` | exact `alarm_man_config` | `configure` | **boot-time** — `AlarmMan.create` writes a default when absent |
| `tfc_dart/core/alarm.dart:303` | `'alarm_man_config'` | `alarm_man_config` | exact | `configure` | behind a control — `addAlarm`/`removeAlarm`/`updateAlarm` only. **`ackAlarm` writes nothing**, so this rule does not stand between an operator and an alarm ack |
| `read_toggles.dart:38, 114` | `McpConfig.kPrefKey` | `mcp.config` | prefix `mcp.` | `administer` | over MCP, not from a widget (§3.2) |
| `lib/core/preferences.dart:54-84` | `key` (a parameter) | pass-through — `SharedPreferencesWrapper` delegates the caller's key | n/a | the caller's | n/a |
| `tfc_dart/core/preferences.dart:344-585` | `key` / `entry.key` (parameters) | pass-through — the cache fan-out inside `Preferences` | n/a | the caller's | n/a |
| `config_service.dart:64` | `_prefCache.clear()` | **not a preference key** — `_prefCache` is a `TtlCache` (`:45`) | n/a | n/a | n/a |

**One key is written outside section 9 and belongs in this table anyway.**
`server_config_envelope` (`lib/core/server_config_db.dart:55`) is written
through raw Drift today, so no `set*` search finds it; it has an exact rule
resolving to `administer`, and plan 03-08 turns it into a `setString` call that
this table's search *will* find on the next run.

**The reconciliation's result.** Every resolvable key expression is matched by
an explicit rule. **No key the app writes in normal operation rests on the
`administer` default.** The one unresolvable expression — `e.key` in the raw
preference editor — is unresolvable by construction rather than by omission, and
sits behind an `administer`-gated route.

The five bold **boot-time** rows and the three **read-path** rows are the ones
that would have broken a plant, and they are why the `when` column exists. Their
owners are in §3.9.

## 6. What this sweep does not cover

Read this before treating the table above as an inventory.

It is a **static text search of the Dart sources in this repository**. It does
not cover reflection, code generated at build time, native plugin channels,
platform channels into Swift/Kotlin/C++, or anything a future package brings in.
It searches `lib`, `centroid-hmi/lib`, `demo` and `packages/*/lib`, and nothing
else — not `test`, not `build`, not `tool`, not the Go manager, not the PLC
sources in `~/Projects/sildarvinnsla`.

Three deliberate limits inside the search itself:

- **Comment-only lines are dropped.** A commented-out call that somebody
  restores is a site the sweep would not have reported until it was restored.
- **Hits in generated files are collapsed to a counted line per file.** The
  counts are printed, so a generated file acquiring hits in an unexpected
  section is visible, but the individual lines are not listed.
- **Section 9b filters `remove` and `clear` by receiver spelling**
  (`pref` / `prefs` / `preferences`). That is a filter on a name, which is the
  exact failure mode this script was built against — a `PreferencesApi` held in
  a field called `_store` would not match it. Section 9c exists as the
  compensation: it prints the census of every receiver 9b dropped, 110 distinct
  spellings, so the omission is scannable rather than silent. It is a weaker
  control than the searches around it, and it is the first place to look if a
  missed preference write is ever found.

**It does not prove a site is unreachable from a widget.** Where a row says
`not widget-reachable` it names the reasoning — a drift `Migrator` callback, a
generated binding with no caller, a `TtlCache` rather than a store — and the
reasoning is checkable by the next reader. That is not the same as a proof, and
this document does not claim it is.

No sentence here says the enumeration is complete. The entire reason this
document exists is that the last such claim was wrong: §6 named three, a fourth
was in the tree the whole time, and §4 above names a fifth. Assume there is a
sixth, re-run `scripts/sweep-write-paths.sh`, and add its rows.

Spec §6 is **not modified by this document**. It is authoritative input to this
phase and plan 03-11 owns any amendment; findings A, B and C in §4.1 are
candidates for it.
