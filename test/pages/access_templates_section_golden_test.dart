/// One golden: the access-templates section, as an administrator holding
/// `users` sees it, with two templates, their bound-key counts and one of them
/// open on its member-to-group rules.
///
/// `access_templates_section.png` — 04-07 built this section and reviewed it
/// through throwaway frames that were deleted; the plan said a golden **of the
/// section** was still owed, and this is it. The three key-repository goldens
/// beside this file are of the *page*, taken before the section existed and
/// re-recorded when it was mounted; none of them shows this card, because they
/// all run with `databaseProvider -> null` and the section renders only the
/// "no reachable database" line in that state.
///
/// **What the image is supposed to show**, so a later reader can check the
/// file rather than a memory:
///
///  * the card header — a shield glyph, `Access templates`, and a live
///    `New template` button (nothing here is greyed for a session that may not
///    use it; the store refuses and the shared prompt explains),
///  * `conveyor`, collapsed, with `2 rules · 2 keys bound` under its name, a
///    rename control and a delete control,
///  * `recipes` below it with `1 rule · 1 key bound`, **expanded** onto its one
///    rule: `The whole key` needing `setpoints`, with the permission in a live
///    dropdown and a remove control beside it,
///  * a scrollbar thumb on the right, because the list is bounded at
///    `kAccessTemplatesListMaxHeight` so it cannot push the key list off a
///    panel — and a bounded list with no scrollbar reads as a list that *ends*
///    where it was cut. `Add rule` is the row below the cut.
///
/// Which template is opened is forced rather than chosen; see the comment at
/// the tap.
///
/// **Fonts are loaded here, twice, deliberately.** `test/pages/` uses
/// `test/flutter_test_config.dart`, which registers **no font at all**, and
/// `lib/theme.dart:349` names `'roboto-mono'` as the theme's family. Without
/// both registrations every `Text` on this card captures as Ahem rectangles
/// and the question this image exists to answer — are the rules legible? —
/// cannot be asked.
///
/// **The themed app**, or `HmiStateColors` falls back to `solarizedLight` and
/// puts violet into a picture of a muted page.
///
/// **Pinned**: `withClock`, an overridden `accessSessionProvider`, and a
/// snapshot already in the resolver — nothing here waits on a loader, so the
/// captured frame is chosen rather than raced.
///
/// **Every fixture is this file's own.** Importing another test file executes
/// its top-level state and makes a baseline nobody can reproduce.
///
/// To update: flutter test test/pages/access_templates_section_golden_test.dart --update-goldens --run-skipped
