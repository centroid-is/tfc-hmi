// The plant view marks the asset whose side pane is open.
//
// A pane is a strip against the right edge of a screen full of machinery. On
// a mimic with four identical conveyors in a row, the pane's header does not
// settle WHICH of them an operator is about to jog — so the asset the pane
// was opened from is outlined for as long as the pane is up.
//
// Nothing about this is per-asset: an asset opens its pane from its own build
// context (it already has to, for `showSidePane`'s `avoidRect`), and the
// `SidePaneSubject` that `AssetStack` puts around every asset is what turns
// that context into "this pane is about that asset".
//
// Contract under test:
//   - a pane opened from inside an asset marks that asset, and only it;
//   - an asset that publishes the shape it takes taps on is marked with that
//     shape, not with its box;
//   - the mark follows a swap to another asset's pane;
//   - closing the pane takes the mark with it;
//   - a pane opened from outside any asset (the page editor's config pane,
//     the database stats pane) marks nothing;
//   - the mark never takes a tap meant for the asset underneath it.
//
// The ring's dashes crawl while it is up, so nothing here settles once a pane
// is open — see `pumpMarked`. What the crawl itself does is
// `hit_boundary_test`'s business; this file is about which asset is ringed.
