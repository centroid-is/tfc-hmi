/// Four goldens of the administration screen — the milestone's last new page.
///
///  * `access_admin_elevated.png`         — the page as the person who commissions a
///    station sees it: three roles with their group summaries and holder counts, three
///    accounts under all four column headings (one of them never signed in), and the
///    "guardrail, not security" note **collapsed**.
///  * `access_admin_operator_warning.png` — the role editor open on `Operator`: the
///    seven `CheckboxListTile`s with their labels *and* their descriptions, in
///    `AccessGroup.values` order, under the persistent warning banner. This is the
///    ROADMAP's named deliverable for the phase.
///  * `access_admin_lockout_refused.png`  — the delete dialog on the only role granting
///    `users`, blocked: the refusal sentence, the remaining holders named, the pointer
///    at the deployment doc's break-glass section, and **no confirming action** anywhere
///    in the frame. There is no typed-confirmation escape and the picture must not look
///    as though there is one.
///  * `access_admin_locked.png`           — the route as a session without `users` meets
///    it: the lock, the group named, the way out still in the app bar and the
///    navigation bar.
///
/// **[AccessAdminBody], never [AccessAdminPage], for the three body images.** The page is
/// a `BaseScaffold` wrapper and `BaseScaffold` calls `context.currentBeamLocation`, so it
/// cannot be pumped without a Beamer ancestor — 06-09 split the two for exactly this. The
/// locked image is the one exception: it is *about* the scaffold the gate puts up, so it
/// brings a router.
///
/// **The locked image is staged from literals.** `AccessGroup.users` from the enum and
/// [_kRouteTitle] as a string in this file. It deliberately does not read the route map's
/// constants: those are written in the same wave as this plan and may not exist at the
/// moment this file is compiled, and the route test is what pins the route's real group
/// and title. A golden's job here is an image, not a route assertion.
///
/// **Fonts are loaded here, twice.** `test/pages/` has no `flutter_test_config.dart` of
/// its own, so it uses `test/flutter_test_config.dart`, which registers **no font at
/// all**; and `lib/theme.dart` names `'roboto-mono'` as the theme's family. Without both
/// registrations every themed `Text` captures as Ahem rectangles and the question these
/// images exist to answer — are the seven descriptions legible? — cannot be asked.
///
/// **The muted (ISA-101) palette.** `HmiStateColors` falls back to `solarizedLight`
/// outside a themed app, which would put violet into pictures of a deliberately muted
/// page. The warning banner in particular has to read as the theme's warning surface and
/// not as orange or red: orange means forced or elevated, red is the plant's fault
/// colour, and nothing on this screen is either.
///
/// **Pinned with `withClock`, and with local-time fixtures.** The account rows render
/// `createdAt` and `lastLoginAt` through `DateFormat(...).format(at.toLocal())`, so the
/// fixture timestamps below are constructed as **local** `DateTime`s — a UTC one would
/// render differently on a machine in another zone and make this baseline unreproducible.
/// The same reasoning pins the shell header's clock.
///
/// **Every fixture, fake and override here is this file's own.** Importing another test
/// file executes its top-level state and makes a baseline nobody can reproduce.
///
