/// The administration page's users section (spec §1, 06-CONTEXT "Users
/// Screen").
///

/// session and reads the rows back from `app_user`, so the claims here are the
/// ones only a rendered screen can make:
///
///  * the four terminal states cannot render as each other — "still loading",
///    "the store errored", "this station has no database" and "the list came
///    back empty" are four different sentences and only one of them is ever
///    true, and the empty one says the first-user window is still open rather
///    than "no users",
///  * the row shows the four columns `AppUser` actually has — username, role,
///    created, last login — and a null last login renders as a word rather
///    than as a blank cell that reads like a rendering bug,
///  * a session without `users` sees every control, may press every one of
///    them, and reaches the shared `AccessDeniedPrompt` — nothing is greyed,
///  * both lockout routes that run through this table are refused *inline*,
///    with the holders counted and named, and no override anywhere,
///  * an admin who demotes or deletes **their own** account loses what it gave
///    them immediately, with no sign-out anywhere in the test,
///  * deleting an account leaves its audit rows alone.
///
/// The store is real, over a real in-memory database, so "the account was
/// deleted" is read back from `app_user` rather than from a mock's call log.
/// The recording subclass exists for the two claims a table cannot answer:
/// which methods the section reached for, and what happens when a write throws
/// something the tables would never produce.
///
/// **Two sessions, on purpose.** The store's gate reads the `session` variable
/// below; `accessSessionProvider` is the real controller and stays anonymous
/// unless a test signs in. On a station those are the same session. Splitting
/// them here is what lets most tests exercise a permitted write without
/// standing up an elevated session — and the two self-privilege tests, which
/// *do* need the real controller, sign in and then make their claim without a
/// sign-out.
