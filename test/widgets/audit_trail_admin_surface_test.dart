/// Phase 6's `admin` surface, through Phase 5's viewer, with Phase 5 unchanged.
///
/// ## What this file is
///
/// A **cross-phase contract test**, owned by Phase 6, asserting a claim Phase 6
/// made about somebody else's code. Plan 06-01 gave every admin row
/// `groupRequired: 'users'` and kept `admin` as a private surface literal
/// specifically so that Phase 5's viewer would need no change; that is a claim
/// about files this phase does not own, made across a phase boundary, and a
/// paragraph in a plan is not evidence for it. This is the evidence.
///
/// The arc under test is the whole contract in one line: **written by Phase 6,
/// selected by Phase 5, with nobody's test double in between.** Every test here
/// drives a real `AccessAdminStore` over a real in-memory database through the
/// real `DriftAuditSink`, and reads the row back through the real
/// [AuditTrailStore]. A hand-built `AuditEntryData` would prove that a
/// hand-written row renders, which is a different and much weaker claim than
/// the one 06-01 made.
///
/// ## The two halves
///
/// **The positive half** is that an admin row survives the default filters, is
/// excluded when the `users` chip is deselected, does not ride in on the auth
/// leg, and renders through the generic write shape.
///
/// **The negative half** is that this works because Phase 5's viewer is
/// generic, not because somebody added a branch to it. The three viewer files
/// carry no `'admin'` literal and no Phase 6 commit has touched them.
///
/// ## What to do if this file goes red
///
/// **Do not patch Phase 5.** A failure here means the vocabulary or the viewer
/// moved and the two phases need reconciling, which is a conversation and not a
/// quiet edit to another phase's committed contract. Read
/// `.planning/phases/05-the-audit-trail-page/deferred-items.md`, the section
/// "For Phase 6", which is where Phase 5 wrote the contract down, and then say
/// which of the two phases moved. Editing `lib/widgets/audit_trail_row.dart`,
/// `lib/widgets/audit_trail_filters.dart` or `lib/core/audit_trail_store.dart`
/// to make this green would delete the finding and keep the defect.
