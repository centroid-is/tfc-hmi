/// The rows the audit trail goldens are pictures of.
///
/// ## Inert on purpose
///
/// No `setUp`, no `setUpAll`, no top-level mutable state, and no
/// `DateTime.now()` anywhere. `alarm_fixture.dart` is the shape this copies and
/// the reason is the same one: a fixture file is *imported* by a golden file,
/// so anything it runs at import time runs before the golden's own `setUpAll`
/// and would be a baseline nobody could reproduce from reading the test. Every
/// instant here is a `DateTime.utc` literal, so `formatTimestamp` — which reads
/// the components off the value's own zone — renders the same string on a
/// machine in Reykjavík and one in Auckland.
///
/// ## Synthetic, and deliberately so
///
/// Every username, station, key and value below is invented. Nothing in this
/// file came off a plant, and no auth row carries an old or new value — the
/// writer withholds them (`packages/tfc_access/lib/src/audit.dart`), so a
/// fixture that supplied them would be picturing something the database cannot
/// hold (T-05-74).
///
/// ## What is in the populated set, and why each row is there
///
/// | Row | What it proves |
/// |---|---|
/// | a denied `configure` write | the leading mark is red, and red is the page's only saturated colour |
/// | an allowed `setpoints` write | an allowed row carries **no** colour at all |
/// | a write with `origin: 'system'` | the inline origin chip, so twelve reconnect rows are identifiable without twelve taps |
/// | a `login` | the orange auth mark, and a row with no `old → new` at all |
/// | a `login.failed` | red beats orange when both would apply — the sign-in did not happen |
/// | a write with `origin: 'mcp'` | `auditOriginLabel` renders the second non-default origin |
/// | a `surface: 'admin'` row | **Phase 6's surface, in a Phase 5 baseline on purpose** |
///
/// That last row is the one worth explaining. `kKnownAuditSurfaces` is a
/// change-detector and not a whitelist, and `AuditEntryLine` branches on
/// `isAuthEntry` and on nothing else — so an unrecognised surface is supposed to
/// take the write shape and render. Putting `role.update` into this fixture buys
/// the visual proof of that in an image that already exists, instead of a
/// seventh baseline showing a row visually identical to one of the others. It
/// also means Phase 6 needs no new golden: its surface is already in the
/// picture. It survives the default filters unchanged, because `admin` rows
/// carry `groupRequired: 'users'` and the `users` chip is selected by default.
