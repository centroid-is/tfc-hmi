/// Goldens for the audit trail page: the six states CONTEXT names, and nothing
/// else.
///
/// Six images:
///
/// * `audit_trail_populated.png`      — the default view: a denial, an allowed write, a `system` origin chip, an orange `login`, and Phase 6's `admin` surface rendering as an ordinary write. 1100x700, the width a 1080p station gives the page and enough height for every row plus the bar.
/// * `audit_trail_filter_bar.png`     — the bar alone, at rest: eight chips with `operate` deselected, the one-line note, the segments, the `Last 7 days` chip. 1100x220, the bar's own height at that width and no list under it to distract from the controls.
/// * `audit_trail_expanded_group.png` — a nine-member action of which three rows survived the filters, open on arrival, with `6 of 9 members hidden by filters` on the parent. 1100x700, the same width as the populated image so a layout diff between the two is a layout diff and not a reflow.
/// * `audit_trail_empty.png`          — the query ran and matched nothing: the bar still on screen above the message, and exactly one `Clear filters`. 1100x500, shorter than the populated image because there is no list to show and a taller frame would be mostly empty surface.
/// * `audit_trail_unavailable.png`    — no database: the unavailable copy, and no filter bar at all. 1100x500, deliberately the same size as the empty image so the two can be laid side by side and must not look alike.
/// * `audit_trail_denied.png`         — `AccessLockedBody(group: users)`, which the route gate renders and this page never does. 900x600, matching `access_locked_page.png` so the two locked bodies are comparable.
///
/// **The muted (ISA-101) palette, not a bare `MaterialApp`.** `HmiStateColors`
/// falls back to `solarizedLight` outside a themed app (`lib/theme.dart:134`),
/// which would put a violet-and-magenta palette into images whose entire subject
/// is one saturated red on a page that carries no other colour. The denial mark
/// and the orange sign-in mark are what these pictures are *of*; drawn from the
/// wrong palette they would be pictures of nothing this build ships.
///
/// **Fonts are loaded here, twice.** `test/widgets/flutter_test_config.dart`
/// registers the TTF under `'Roboto'` alone, but `lib/theme.dart:349` names
/// `'roboto-mono'` as the theme's family; an unregistered family falls back to
/// Ahem, so every themed `Text` would capture as a solid rectangle. Same helper
/// as `test/page_creator/assets/aircab_golden_test.dart:105-125` and
/// `access_gate_golden_test.dart`.
///
/// **The `RepaintBoundary` is deliberately not the direct child of
/// `Scaffold.body`.** Scaffold paints its background outside that subtree, and a
/// boundary placed there captures a transparent image. Phase 1 shipped two of
/// those before the trap was written down in `access_gate_golden_test.dart`.
///
/// **Every host in this file is this file's own.** The loader and the locked
/// page host are modelled on `access_gate_golden_test.dart` and copied rather
/// than imported: importing another test file executes its top-level state, and
/// a golden that depended on a neighbour's `setUp` is a baseline nobody can
/// reproduce. `audit_trail_fixture.dart` is the one import, and only because it
/// is inert — no `setUp`, no `setUpAll`, no top-level mutable state.
///
/// **Every test asserts the state it claims before it captures it.** A frame
/// that had not decided yet matches its own wrong baseline perfectly on every
/// subsequent run, which is exactly the failure the milestone's Definition of
/// Done exists to make unavoidable (T-05-70). So each test names its own
/// terminal key present and the competing keys absent, and only then opens the
/// shutter.
///
/// **The seam is `auditTrailStoreProvider`, not `auditTrailEntriesProvider`.**
/// Riverpod 2's generated `AuditTrailEntriesFamily` carries no family-level
/// `overrideWith` — only a *resolved* `auditTrailEntriesProvider(query)` has one
/// — and overriding by resolved query would mean this file had to reconstruct
/// the query the page issues. 05-06 found the same thing and took the same way
/// out. Overriding the store is also stronger: the real provider runs, so the
/// grouping, the companion count and the `reachedLimit` arithmetic in these
/// pictures are the production ones.
///
