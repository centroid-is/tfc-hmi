/// in the tree since 2026-08-27 and given no row by the 2026-08-29 sweep. See
/// the document's §4.1 F.
///
/// **Matched by file, never by line.** Every line number in the document's
/// §2.1 changed between the two runs and not one of the calls did: plan 03-10
/// moved five writes from `adb.deleteHistoryView(...)` to
/// `store.deleteHistoryView(...)` and everything below shifted. A check that
/// fails on reformatting gets deleted rather than fixed, so the reconciliation
/// key is the **file path**, and the call shape is checked separately for
/// script section 1 — the section whose grep is by method name and where the
/// fourth bypass hid.
///
/// **Not for CI.** It shells out to bash and reads a markdown document. It
/// belongs in the local suite the phase gate runs, which `flutter test test/`
/// picks up. Do not wire it into `.github/workflows/test.yml`: it would be the

/// reason nobody has time to read. `scripts/check-preferences-construction.sh`
/// is the part of this that *is* a CI gate, and plan 03-11 owns it.
///
/// The behavioural half complements `test/providers/guard_wiring_test.dart`
