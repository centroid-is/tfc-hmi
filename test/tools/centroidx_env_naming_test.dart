/// The mechanical gate for the legacy-acronym retirement.
///
/// **Why this exists.** Both feature flags in `lib/core/feature_flags.dart`
/// default to `true`. A build invocation that still passes
/// `--dart-define=TFC_CHAT=false` after the rename does not fail: the define
/// simply names a constant nothing reads any more, it is silently ignored, and
/// the shipped binary gets chat and the knowledge features compiled **in**. On
/// a customer station. Nothing at runtime re-checks that decision, and the
/// build log looks identical either way. A careful sweep cannot prevent that
/// class of mistake. A test that reads the tree from disk can.
///
/// **Comments are in scope; they are deliberately not stripped.** Every
/// workflow's hit comes in a pair — a `#` line explaining the flag, then the
/// `run:` line using it (see `.github/workflows/macos.yml:128` and `:130`). A
/// stale comment reading "TFC_CHAT off" sitting above a `CENTROIDX_CHAT`
/// define is precisely the confusion that ships the wrong binary to a panel, so
/// the comment is as much a defect as the define. `package_purity_test.dart`
/// strips comments because there the comment *names* the forbidden strings in
/// order to explain the rule; here the comment is part of the rule's surface.
///
/// **There is no allowlist, and adding one is not the fix.**
/// `TFC_ALLOW_FLUTTER_SKEW` is an environment key that the phase's rename table
/// did not originally cover, and the obvious cheap answer was to exempt it, or
/// to exempt `scripts/` and `test/tools/` wholesale. It was renamed instead
/// (plan 07-03). An exemption list is the exact hole this gate exists to close:
/// the next key added to it is the one that ships the wrong binary, and the
/// entry will look reasonable at the time it is written.
///
/// **Self-exclusion.** This file names the retired acronym in prose, above, so
/// it excludes itself from the scan — by exact path, once, at `_selfPath`. That
/// exclusion is the one soft spot in the design, so the
/// `the gate found what it is supposed to read` group makes it load-bearing: it
/// asserts the file at `_selfPath` exists, is non-empty, is absent from the
/// scanned set, and contains the assembled token. An exclusion nobody checks is
/// an allowlist with one entry.
