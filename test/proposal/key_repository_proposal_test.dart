  // commit/discard once and stays up while the operator navigates, and its
  // button holds the callback captured on the banner's last build -- so the
  // closure can be pressed after this page's subtree has gone. That is what
  // these do: take the published closure, take the page out of the tree, call
  // it.
  //
  // That yields a *disposed* state, not the deactivated-but-still-mounted one
  // the incident hit. Flutter unmounts inactive elements in finalizeTree at
  // the end of the frame that deactivated them, so no widget test can hold
  // that window open across an await. The two differ only in where the old
  // code died: deactivated, on the snackbar's ancestor lookup inside
  // _saveKeyMappings; disposed, one line later on
  // `ref.read(proposalStateProvider.notifier)` in _commitProposals. The
  // outcome asserted here -- mappings written, nothing accepted -- is the
