/// Pressing Accept on a single proposal has to finish the job.
///
/// The banner's Accept used to be a bare
/// `proposalStateProvider.notifier.acceptProposal(id)`: it marked the
/// proposal decided and dropped it from state without applying anything.
/// `_buildAcceptAllButton` had documented that trap for the batch buttons
/// since they were written -- "that marks a proposal accepted ... without
/// ever applying the patch, so the edit is silently lost" -- but the
/// single-proposal row kept calling it.
///
/// Reported on 2026-08-31 against a `delete_alarm` proposal: "When there is
/// one proposed item and I click accept it does not follow through and
/// finish. I have to scroll down and click remove alarm in the last
/// proposal." Accept took the banner away, `AlarmMan` was never asked to
/// remove anything, and the alarm editor was left holding the staged removal
/// with its own "Remove Alarm" button -- the only control on screen that was
/// actually deleting the alarm.
///
/// These tests drive the real banner over the real alarm editor and watch
/// what AlarmMan was asked to do. The sibling
/// `alarm_editor_delete_batch_test.dart` calls the editor's commit callback
/// directly, which is exactly why it stayed green through this bug: it never
/// pressed the button the operator presses.
