/// [_KeyMappingsSection] stages proposals two ways: from `proposalStateProvider`
/// (each carrying an id) and from the JSON the route hands it, which carries
/// none — the chat batch card calls `acceptAllOfType()` first, so the
/// proposals are already out of state by the time it beams here. The second
/// path is a fallback, taken whenever state holds nothing.

/// Beamer keeps that JSON on the location, so every later mount of the
/// section is handed it again — and after an accept, state *is* empty, which
/// is exactly what the fallback triggers on. So mounting the section again
/// staged the accepted proposal a second time. These tests mount it again by
/// leaving the page and coming back, which is what the operator did; a plain
/// window resize does it too, without any navigation at all, because
/// [KeyRepositoryContent] swaps LayoutBuilder branches at 320 px and the
/// section lands in a different place in the tree.
///
/// Sibling of `alarm_editor_routed_accept_test.dart` (#358), which pinned the
/// other half of the same invariant: the batch leaves when it is accepted.
