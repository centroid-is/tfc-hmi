// Rebuilding a conveyor must not re-open its PLC subscriptions.
//
// The conveyor assembled its streams inside `build`, so `StreamBuilder` was
// handed a brand-new stream object every time the widget rebuilt. A new
// object means cancel the old subscription and open a fresh one. Resizing the
// window rebuilds continuously — so does dragging an asset around the page
// editor — and every conveyor on the page dropped and re-made all of its
// subscriptions once a frame.
//
// What that cost, measured on the plant HMI:
//
//   * ~130 KiB of log a second while a window edge was being dragged, against
//     nothing at all once the mouse stopped. The app log had reached 1.5 GB.
//   * StateMan's retry ladder never advanced. It climbs 1s, 10s, 60s, 600s and
//     then logs only every tenth attempt, so a key bound to a node the PLC
//     does not have should cost about six lines an hour. Every restart put it
//     back at the beginning: across a 4 MB slice of log, attempts 1 through 4
//     appeared 590 times and attempt 5 never once.
//   * A window that visibly lagged the mouse, because each frame asked the
//     server for a fresh set of monitored items and threw away the ones it
//     had made a frame earlier.
//
// The visible symptom in the log is a tight cycle, per key, per frame:
//
//     listener added (count=1) → listener removed (count=0)
//       → no listeners left, starting 600s idle timer → listener added …
//
// So: one subscription per key, held across rebuilds, and re-made only when
// the conveyor is actually pointed at different keys.
