// Regression test: a failing OPTIONAL stream must not take the conveyor down.
//
// BUG (2026-08-18, production): every conveyor on one page
// rendered as disconnected (grey), while conveyors on another page on the SAME
// three PLCs, over the SAME sessions, were fine.
//
// The conveyor combines drive + batches + frequency + trip with
// CombineLatestStream, which propagates an error from ANY input, and the
// builder turns `snapshot.hasError` straight into the disconnected visual.
// So binding `batchesKey` to a node the PLC answered with BadDeviceFailure
// blanked the whole asset even though its drive key was healthy and reading
// all along. The wet-area conveyors have no `batchesKey`, which is why they
// were untouched -- and what identified the mechanism.
//
// The same line has a quieter second failure: CombineLatest does not emit
// until EVERY input has produced a first value, so an optional stream that
// merely stays silent blanks the asset just as effectively as one that
// errors.
//
// `key` (the drive) stays fatal on purpose: without it the conveyor really
// has no state, and grey is the honest answer.

/// A conveyor is "disconnected" when the builder took its error/no-data
/// path, which is exactly when [ConveyorPainter.showExclamation] is set.
///
/// Do NOT test this by comparing the painter colour to [Colors.grey]: the
/// disconnected colour is `HmiStateColors.of(context).grey`, which under a
/// bare `MaterialApp` falls back to Solarized `base1` and never equals
/// `Colors.grey`. Such a check reads "connected" for every rendered
/// conveyor and passes whether or not the bug is fixed.
