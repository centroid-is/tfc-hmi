// Regression test: "Simulate batches" toggle must start the simulation timer
// even when no PLC keys are configured.
//
// BUG: In the runtime Conveyor widget, the start/stop logic for the batch
// simulation timer was buried inside StreamBuilder.builder, which only fires
// once at least one stream has data. With no keys configured, the widget
// early-returned before reaching the simulation toggle check, so flipping
// `simulateBatches` had no visible effect.
//
// We verify behavior by reaching into the painter's `batches` map: the timer
// inserts a Batch on its first tick, so a non-empty map after pumping a few
// frames proves the simulation timer is running.

/// Walks the rendered tree from [tester] looking for a [CustomPaint] whose
/// painter exposes a `batches` field (i.e. the internal _ConveyorPainter).
/// Returns the painter or null if not found.
