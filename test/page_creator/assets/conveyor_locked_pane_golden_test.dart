/// One golden: the conveyor's side pane, anonymous, with `p_cfg_ManualFreq`
/// **locked and still showing its number** while the jog buttons stay
/// ordinary.
///
/// `conveyor_locked_pane.png` — the phase's acceptance sentence as a picture.
/// `conveyor_tap_time_test.dart` already asserts it (one write for the jog,
/// none for the frequency, a prompt naming `setpoints`), but an assertion
/// cannot say whether the value beside the lock is *legible*, whether the lock
/// reads as a fault, or whether the two jog buttons look any different from
/// the locked field above them. Spec §9b: a passing golden is not review, so
/// this image exists to be opened and looked at.
///
/// **What the image is supposed to show**, so a later reader can check it
/// against the file rather than against a memory:
///
///  * `Manual frequency` rendered as a bordered field carrying `37.50` and a
///    small lock glyph on its right — not blanked, not greyed, not replaced
///    by the word "Locked",
///  * `Auto frequency` locked the same way (`45.00`) — the §7b template gates
///    both frequencies — and `Cleaning frequency` (`12.00`) **editable**, so
///    the lock cannot be a pane that locked everything,
///  * the jog buttons and the continuous switch drawn exactly as they are on
///    an unbound station: `p_cmd_JogFwd -> operate` and the session holds
///    `operate`.
///
/// **Fonts are loaded here, twice, deliberately.** `test/page_creator/` has no
/// `flutter_test_config.dart` of its own and the root one registers **no font
/// at all**; `lib/theme.dart:349` names `'roboto-mono'` as the theme's family.
/// Without both registrations every themed `Text` in this pane captures as
/// Ahem rectangles and the "is the number legible" question cannot be
/// answered. MaterialIcons comes out of the SDK cache for the lock, the
/// header glyph and the jog arrows.
///
/// **The themed app, not a bare `MaterialApp`.** `HmiStateColors.of` falls
/// back to `solarizedLight` when the theme carries no extension, which would
/// put violet into an image whose whole subject is a muted pane.
///
/// **Pinned with `withClock`** and with an overridden `accessSessionProvider`,
/// so nothing here depends on when it ran or on a controller chain settling:
/// the real session controller reaches the database, the preferences store and
/// the station keychain, and a frame captured before it resolves renders every
/// control in its loading state.
///
/// **Every fixture here is this file's own**, copied from
/// `conveyor_tap_time_test.dart` rather than imported. Importing another test
/// file executes its top-level state and makes a baseline nobody can
/// reproduce.
///
