// No asset re-opens its PLC subscriptions when it is merely redrawn.
//
// Every asset that reads a key used to build its stream inside `build`, so
// `StreamBuilder` was handed a new stream object on every rebuild — and a new
// object means cancel the old subscription and open a fresh one. Resizing a
// window rebuilds continuously, and so does dragging an asset around the page
// editor. Measured on the plant HMI while a window edge was dragged: ~130 KiB
// of log a second against nothing once the mouse stopped, and a window that
// lagged the mouse.
//
// This drives each asset through twenty frames of a resize and asserts that
// what reaches StateMan does not move.
//
// It also catches the subtler way of getting this wrong. `keyStreamProvider`
// is auto-disposed, so it stays alive only while something *watches* it — and
// a `ref.watch` is only a watch when it happens during that widget's own
// build. Reading it from inside a `StreamBuilder`'s builder instead, which
// belongs to a different element, registers nothing: the dependency lapses
// and the shared stream is disposed underneath the asset. Rendering each one
// for real is what shows the difference.
