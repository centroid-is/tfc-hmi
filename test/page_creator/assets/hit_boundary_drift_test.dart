// A published hit shape has to keep being true.
//
// The plant view outlines the shape an asset publishes with `AssetHitShape`
// rather than probing it, because probing costs ten thousand hit tests per
// pane and an asset that knows its own shape should not have to be
// interrogated for it. The price of that is a promise: the published path is
// the path the hit test answers from. Nothing in the type system holds
// anyone to it — a refactor that changes `ConveyorPainter.hitTest` and leaves
// `hitShape` alone would put the mark quietly back to lying, which is the one
// failure the mark exists to prevent.
//
// So this is the alarm. It probes the widget's real hit test the expensive
// way and holds the answer against the published path, point by point. It
// belongs here and not in the app: CI has the ten thousand hit tests to
// spare, and an operator opening a pane does not.
