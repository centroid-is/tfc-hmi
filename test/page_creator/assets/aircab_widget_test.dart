/// The air cabinet asset takes its chrome from the color scheme.

/// all baked in. On the dark scheme that is a bright grey card with white
/// dots, regardless of what the operator picked in preferences.

/// RGBA values: the same widget under [solarized]'s light and dark themes
/// must paint differently, and each must match the scheme it was given. A
/// literal passes an equality check against whichever theme it happened to
/// be written for; it cannot pass both at once.
