# Enumerate every path from Dart code in this repository to a persistent store.
#
# Why this exists: `docs/access-control-spec.md` §6 lists the write paths that
# bypass `StateMan.write` and `PreferencesApi.set*` — the two interfaces the
# Phase 3 guards wrap. That list was written as three. A fourth of exactly the
# same shape (the history view's Drift deletes) had been sitting in the tree the
# whole time and was found only because somebody read an unrelated comment and
# checked one claim. §6 now says outright: assume there is a fifth. This script
# is what stops the next person having to take that on trust.
#
# It is a REPORT, not a gate. It exits 0 whether it finds one site or a hundred,
# and it is *expected* to find legitimate ones — the guards themselves,
# `DriftAuditSink` (append-only by design), the preference providers, the store
# implementations in `packages/tfc_dart/lib/core/`. Finding a site is not a
# defect; a site with no verdict is. `docs/access-control-write-path-sweep.md`
# is where each hit gets its verdict. Plan 03-11 turns a subset of section 4
# into a CI gate; plan 03-12 re-runs this script and asserts every hit still has
# a row in that document.
#
# Two design rules, both bought with real mistakes:
#
#   * SEARCH FOR THE THING, NOT FOR ITS SPELLING. The two history-view deletes
#     go through different accessors — `adb.deleteHistoryView(...)` and
#     `dbWrap.db.deleteHistoryViewPeriod(...)` — so a grep keyed on the receiver
#     name finds one and misses the other. Section 1 therefore searches the
#     *method names* declared on `AppDatabase`, and section 3 searches the
#     *type* `AppDatabase` and the `.db` accessor, not `adb` or `dbWrap`.
#
#   * USE THE SAME ROOTS EVERYWHERE. Section 9 covers `lib` and `packages/*/lib`
#     exactly like sections 1-8. Hand-naming a couple of files there is how
#     `packages/tfc_mcp_server/lib/src/tools/read_toggles.dart:38` escaped the
#     first pass.
#
# Two output conventions, so nothing is hidden without saying so:
#
#   * Lines whose first non-space character starts a comment (`//`, `/*`, `*`)
#     are dropped. A comment is not a call. This is why
#     `centroid-hmi/lib/main.dart:449`, which quotes `adb.deleteHistoryView`
#     inside a note, does not appear as a site.
#   * Hits in generated files (`*.g.dart`, `*.freezed.dart`, `*.gen.dart`) are
#     collapsed to one `[generated] <file> (N occurrences ...)` line per file
#     rather than listed. Generated code is regenerated from a source file that
#     IS searched here, and drift's `database_drift.g.dart` alone carries 179
#     mentions of `AppDatabase`. The count is still printed, so a generated file
#     that suddenly acquires hits in an unexpected section is visible.
#
# Both conventions are limits on the search, and both are restated in section 6
# of the sweep document. Nothing in this script proves a site is unreachable
# from a widget; it finds the sites, and a human writes the reasoning.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/sweep-write-paths.sh
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  the report was produced (always, when it could run)
#   2  the search roots could not be located
