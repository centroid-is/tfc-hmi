# Fail the build when anything outside `lib/providers/` constructs a
# device-local preferences store.
#
# Why this exists: `docs/access-control-spec.md` §6 asks for exactly this
# check, and gives the reason — "this is the invariant that will rot silently
# — every future feature that news up its own preferences reopens the hole and
# the type system will not object." A store constructed in a widget is not
# wrapped by `GuardedPreferences`, so its writes pass no check and leave no
# audit row, and nothing about the code looks wrong.
#
# The fix for a hit is one line:
#
#   * where a `ref` is available (any `ConsumerWidget` / `ConsumerState`), read
#     `localPreferencesProvider` — it is overridable in a test, the factory is
#     not;
#   * where there is none (a static method, a plain function, anything before
#     `runApp`), call `createDeviceLocalPreferences()` from
#     `lib/providers/preferences.dart`.
#
# TWO patterns, not one. Spec §6 names only `SharedPreferencesAsync()`. The
# legacy synchronous `SharedPreferences.getInstance()` reaches the same
# per-device store and a check written to §6's wording would never see it, so
# it is covered here as well. It is in the tree today — see the allow list.
#
# This check is the ENFORCED SUBSET of `scripts/sweep-write-paths.sh`, whose
# sections 4 and 5 are these two patterns. That script is a report over nine
# kinds of write path and always exits 0; this one is a gate over two of them.
# Do not grow this file into a second sweep — add a section there instead, and
# `docs/access-control-write-path-sweep.md` is where every hit gets a verdict.
#
# NO LOCKFILE, DELIBERATELY. `/pubspec.lock` is gitignored (`.gitignore:26`),
# so any check keyed on a resolved dependency would find nothing in a fresh CI
# checkout and pass vacuously. This check reads source files only. Do not add
# a dependency-based variant.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-preferences-construction.sh [--quiet]
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  no construction outside `lib/providers/`
#   1  at least one found — the offending file and line are printed
#   2  the check could not be run (no search roots)

  A store constructed here is not wrapped by GuardedPreferences: its writes
  pass no access check and leave no audit row, and nothing about the call
  site looks wrong. See docs/access-control-spec.md §6.

  The fix is one line:

    * a `ref` is in scope (ConsumerWidget, ConsumerState) —
        ref.read(localPreferencesProvider)
      This is the better fix: a test can override the provider.

    * no `ref` (a static method, a plain function, anything before runApp) —
        createDeviceLocalPreferences()      // lib/providers/preferences.dart

  If the site genuinely cannot use either, the allow list at the top of this
  script takes an entry — with its reason, and a row in
  docs/access-control-write-path-sweep.md.
